The site will be the first to launch in the United States with a legal nod from Nevada regulators.  Nevada approved their final amended bill allowing online poker in February.</p>
<p>Ultimate Poker is majority owned by <a href="https://www.sclv.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.sclv.com/', 'Station Casinos LLC']);" title="Station Casinos Las Vegas"  target="_blank">Station Casinos LLC</a> (Frank and Lorenzo Fertitta of Fertitta Interactive), who operate 16 brick and mortar casinos in Southern Nevada. Ultimate Gaming acquired California based CyberArts in 2011 and therefore owns its own software platform to be utilized for gaming.</p>
<p>Any person over the age of 21 and physically located within Nevada boundaries will be permitted to play for real money on the site. Persons registering on the site will be required to provide their social security number, their identity, age, address, mobile phone number and contact details, including a valid e-mail address, their place of residence, and relevant payment information. Verification of each player&#8217;s identity and their physical location at time of play will be implemented.</p>
<p>Players will be able to deposit or cash out in person any any one of the Station Casino locations in Nevada.  Online deposits will also be accepted via e-checks, bank wires and check by mail. Daily and monthly limits on deposit amounts will be implemented, dependant on player history, deposit method and account status. According to their website, limits on withdrawals will be imposed as well, with similar criteria being considered.</p>
<p>Ultimate Poker is the exclusive partner of the <a href="http://www.ufc.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.ufc.com/', 'Ultimate Fighting Championship']);" title="UFC"  target="_blank">Ultimate Fighting Championship</a> (UFC).

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>Thousands of speakers, delegates and news media personnel descended on San Francisco last week for the <a href="http://www.gigse.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.gigse.com/', 'Global iGaming Summit and Expo']);" title="GiGse 2013"  target="_blank">Global iGaming Summit and Expo</a>. An unexpected lively panel on day one kept the entire contingent buzzing all week.</p>
<p>The panel discussion was set to discuss licensing suitability, including the legal and commercial rationale of excluding off- shore operators. The panel included John Pappas, executive director of the <a href="http://theppa.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://theppa.org/', 'Poker Players Alliance']);" title="PPA"  target="_blank">Poker Players Alliance</a>, Jan Jones-Blackhurst, senior Vice President of Communications and Government Relations of <a href="http://www.caesars.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.caesars.com/', 'Caesars Entertainment ']);" title="Caesars"  target="_blank">Caesars Entertainment </a>and Michael Rumbolz, Management Committee of <a href="http://www.hardrock.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.hardrock.com/', 'Seminole Hard Rock International']);" title="Hard Rock"  target="_blank">Seminole Hard Rock International</a>.</p>
<p>It was Jan Jones that came out swinging.  Moderator Chris Krafcik, Research Director of <a href="http://www.gamblingcompliance.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.gamblingcompliance.com/', 'Gambling Compliance']);" title="Gambling Compliance"  target="_blank">Gambling Compliance</a>, had barely introduced the topic when Jones began on her mission to make clear her position that any company operating in the United States market after UIGEA was passed in 2006 should not be welcome in a regulated market now.   She claimed that many people were wrong about UIGEA in thinking that it referred to just the monetary side of transactions, that instead, UIGEA made all operations of online gaming in the U.S. illegal.</p>
<p>Pappas came back explaining that UIGEA should not be construed to be the determining factor for who is licensed or not, that the regulatory agencies are capable of investigating and deciding who is suitable for licensing.      <a href="http://diamondflushpoker.com/2013/04/sparks-fly-at-gigse-when-caesars-takes-aim-at-pokerstars/#more-3649" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

<p>In a federal courtroom in New York city today, Judge Loretta Preska accepted a guilty plea from Ray Bitar and sentenced him to time served.</p>
<p>Exactly two years since Black Friday, Ray Bitar appeared in the courtroom via a live video stream from a courtroom in Los Angeles. Judge Preska ran the proceedings from New York with  U.S. Attorney Arlo Devlin-Brown and Niketh Velamoor present along with Bitar&#8217;s attorney Jack Baughman. In Los Angeles, Bitar was flanked by attorneys Roberto Finzi and Steven Jacobs.</p>
<p>Bitar entered the courtroom on his own, but was allowed to remain seated during the proceedings. His family and a few friends were visible in the gallery.   <a href="http://diamondflushpoker.com/2013/04/judge-accepts-guilty-pleas-from-bitar-sentences-him-to-time-served-plus-massive-forfeitures/#more-3642" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>Former online poker payment processor Chad Elie has filed a lawsuit in Las Vegas against one of his former attorneys, <a title="Jeff Ifrah" href="www.Ifrahlaw.com" target="_blank">Jeff Ifrah</a>, claiming that Ifrah misled him about documentation that would have, if known by Elie, kept him from being imprisoned.</p>
<p>According to the 20 page <a href="http://www.onlinepokerreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/elie-complaint-text-searchable.pdf" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','download','http://www.onlinepokerreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/elie-complaint-text-searchable.pdf']);" title="Elie v Ifrah"  target="_blank">complaint</a>, Elie alleges that Ifrah failed to disclose to his client legal opinions that processing online poker was illegal in the U.S. in order for Ifrah to continue to collect commissions on the processing that Elie was handling for his clients. The complaint also alleges that Ifrah had a clear conflict of interest to represent Elie, while representing poker companies Full Tilt Poker and PokerStars and that he put the interests of those companies ahead of Elie&#8217;s.  The complaint further alleges that Ifrah provided testimony against Elie, to the U.S. Attorneys Office, in the investigation which resulted in the indictments unsealed on Black Friday in order to keep from being indicted himself.</p>
<p>There are no quotes from Elie himself, or citings from specific documents to corroborate any of the allegations in the complaint.</p>
<p>Diamond Flush Poker having met with Elie in the past, <a title="Elie Interview" href="http://diamondflushpoker.com/2012/11/payment-processor-chad-elie-speaks-out/ " target="_blank">published an interview</a> held with Elie in November 2012.  None of these allegations were made at that time, even though Elie had had benefit of tens of thousands of pages of discovery for more than a year prior. In fact, in conversations with this author, Elie has expressed nothing but high regard for Ifrah and the support he had received from him, and this sentiment was repeated right up until the time he was incarcerated in late January 2013. He would have had benefit of all discovery in the case against him prior to this time, but made no comments about Ifrah&#8217;s alleged cooperation with the government against Elie or others.</p>
<p>Elie also advised this author that he had met Ifrah in 2009 when Ifrah was suing him, on behalf of PokerStars, for money that Elie &#8220;stole&#8221; from another payment processor, Intabill. Elie claimed to have taken more than $ 4 million from Intabill&#8217;s bank accounts for himself because he was owed that much from his fellow processor, but had not been paid.  That $ 4 million, along with many millions more, had been stolen by Intabill from PokerStars and Full Tilt Poker and Elie was being sued for the recovery of that money.  Elie eventually settled the case, agreeing to return approximately 50% of that money, more than $ 2 million to PokerStars. Sources have told Diamond Flush Poker that this repayment of funds from Elie came in large part via $ 100,000. monthly installments, payment being made to Ifrah Law into client PokerStars account.  Since the complaint does not address this issue, it remains unclear whether this is the same $ 100,000. alleged to have been paid to Ifrah as &#8220;commissions&#8221;.</p>
<p>From immediately following his indictment in 2011, until he changed his plea in April 2012, Elie prepared for trial in New York to fight the allegations against him.  As part of that preparation, his criminal defense team filed <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BxNSLF3qCn56OUR3ZXdsbGpSQ3FNVFNTV1VGSURsUQ/edit" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BxNSLF3qCn56OUR3ZXdsbGpSQ3FNVFNTV1VGSURsUQ/edit', 'numerous motions']);" title="Elie defense article"  target="_blank">numerous motions</a> with the court.  Included in those motions were the various <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BxNSLF3qCn56ZTdaVmc2NGFSeTZDWW1pZkVHbzA2QQ/edit" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BxNSLF3qCn56ZTdaVmc2NGFSeTZDWW1pZkVHbzA2QQ/edit', 'legal opinions ']);" title="legal opinions"  target="_blank">legal opinions </a>collected by Elie prior to his arrest, including the legal opinion referred to in this complaint, that alleges he had no knowledge of until after he was arrested.</p>
<p>Elie ultimately decided to plead guilty to felonies that landed him a five month prison term.  During his allocutions before Judge Lewis Kaplan in New York, he was specifically asked by Kaplan to confirm that by Elie admitting to having committed bank fraud and conspiracy charges that he did not in any way rely on any &#8220;advice of counsel&#8221; defense for his actions.  Kaplan went so far as to reinforce the question multiple times.  Elie answered &#8220;no&#8221;, he had not acted on advice of counsel and that he committed the acts with criminal intent.</p>
<p>Diamond Flush Poker received the following statement from Jeff Ifrah regarding the complaint:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;While we do not relish being adversarial with a former client, at the appropriate time we will demonstrate that Mr. Elie’s claims are factually incorrect and legally meritless.  It is more than regrettable that he would strike out at others and seek to blame them for his situation.  He is, after all,  presently in federal prison for crimes he admitted to.  Our further response to his irresponsible accusations will take place in a courtroom.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The complaint was filed by Las Vegas Family Law Attorney <a href="http://www.sigalchattahlaw.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.sigalchattahlaw.com/', 'Sigal Chattah']);" title="Sigal Chattah Law"  target="_blank">Sigal Chattah</a>.  She could not be reached for comment before publication time.</p>

<p>Late this afternoon in the Federal Courthouse in New York City, <a href="http://www.paulweiss.com/professionals/partners-and-counsel/john-f-baughman.aspx" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.paulweiss.com/professionals/partners-and-counsel/john-f-baughman.aspx', 'Jack Baughman']);" title="Bitar attorney Jack Baughman"  target="_blank">Jack Baughman</a>, attorney for Ray Bitar, stood before the judge and explained that the defense and the prosecution have reached an agreement that would provide no prison term for Bitar.</p>
<p>The provision apparently agreed to by the parties will see Bitar plead guilty to at least two felony charges and will require him to forfeit nearly all the money he earned a Full Tilt Poker, including his home and other real estate and investments.</p>
<p>Bitar, former CEO of Full Tilt Poker, was <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B6sKjUYL3e6LZGM0Y2I3ODAtMmM3MC00Mjc2LWE4OGYtNDZhYWNmYzUwM2U3/edit?hl=en&amp;authkey=CJ6Jmu0C" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B6sKjUYL3e6LZGM0Y2I3ODAtMmM3MC00Mjc2LWE4OGYtNDZhYWNmYzUwM2U3/edit?hl=en&amp;authkey=CJ6Jmu0C', 'indicted']);" title="Black Friday Indictment"  target="_blank">indicted</a> by the U.S. Attorneys Office on &#8220;Black Friday&#8221;, April 15, 2011, charged with numerous felonies related to online poker in the U.S.  <a title="Bitar surrenders and faces more charges" href="http://diamondflushpoker.com/2012/07/ray-bitar-surrenders-in-new-york-city-new-charges-filed/" target="_blank">Further charges were added</a> when Bitar returned to the U.S. and surrendered to authorities last summer.  He has remained free on bail since July 2012, but wears an electronic monitoring device, residing in Southern California.</p>
<p>Baughman explained to Judge Loretta A Preska, Chief U.S. District Judge, and the sitting Judge in Bitar&#8217;s case, that his request to the court entails the judge agreeing to hear, and presumably accept, a guilty plea from Bitar  and sentence him the same day. Normally there would be a 90 day period in which presentencing investigations and reports are completed.</p>
<p>That 90 days could prove more critical to Bitar than anyone may have realized.  Bitar is suffering from a severe heart condition, diagnosed in November 2012, that can be treated no other way than through a heart transplant, or the implementation of &#8220;an artificial heart&#8221;.  Baughman presented the court with Bitar&#8217;s medical records for her review, and he advised the court, that the defense and prosecution with the medical issues in mind, have been working toward some resolution in this case since January.    <a href="http://diamondflushpoker.com/2013/04/ray-bitar-will-ask-court-for-no-incarceration-in-order-to-receive-a-heart-transplant/#more-3630" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

<p>On March 4, 2012, the American Gaming Association (AGA) <a title="AGA files petition in NJ" href="http://diamondflushpoker.com/2013/03/american-gaming-association-files-petition-to-bar-pokerstars-from-atlantic-city/" target="_blank">filed a petition </a>in New Jersey to request permission to participate in oral or written arguments that determine whether PokerStars will be granted an Interim Casino Authorization. This temporary license is necessary to own and operate the Atlantic Club Casino, the brick and mortar facility that PokerStars is in the process of purchasing, pending a formal permanent licensing sometime in the future. The petition, along with the AGA petition with their claims that the license should not be granted, was filed with the Casino Control Commission and forwarded to the Division of Gaming Enforcement for review. The DGE will advise the Commission of their recommendation, but the final decision rests with the Commission. Attorneys for PokerStars filed their own brief on why the AGA lacks standing to be heard. The matter was not heard during the regular <a title="CCC tables AGA hearing" href="http://diamondflushpoker.com/2013/03/n-j-commission-tables-hearing-for-american-gaming-association-standing-in-pokerstars-case/" target="_blank">monthly meeting in March,</a> but was adjourned until some future date.</p>
<span id="AGA_Petitions_are_Riddled_with_Inaccuracies_about_PokerStars"><h2> AGA Petitions are Riddled with Inaccuracies about PokerStars</h2></span>
<p>The AGA&#8217;s petition for standing claims to represent the interest of its 62 members (consisting of casino companies, gaming equipment manufacturers, financial services companies, professional services firms, suppliers and vendors, state gaming associations, publications and labor unions) in &#8220;promoting and insuring the integrity of the commercial casino industry&#8221; and that the outcome of the licensing hearing for PokerStars directly affects those interests. It is on this basis, and their proclaimed &#8220;need to insure that only individuals and entities of established integrity are licensed&#8221;, that AGA asserts their standing. The AGA does not say which or how many of its members have sanctioned this action, but sources have confirmed that the vote to proceed was <em>not</em> unanimous. The AGA  does point out that some AGA members own/operate gaming establishments in New Jersey.  They claim to have assembled substantial materials as to the backgrounds of the individuals and entities named in the PokerStars application, including criminal proceedings, and that submitting these documents to the Division and the Commission will further their interests in &#8220;maintaining the integrity of the industry&#8221;.</p>
<p>Despite the claims AGA make, neither PokerStars, nor any affiliated entities named in their application for licensing, have ever faced criminal proceedings. Furthermore, none, not one, of the four individuals named for PokerStars in their application, have ever faced criminal charges.     <a href="http://diamondflushpoker.com/2013/03/has-the-aga-been-honest-about-their-motives-or-just-very-selective-as-to-its-prey/#more-3615" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>The meeting of the Casino Control Commission in Atlantic City, New Jersey  on Wednesday was uneventful as to the matter of whether the American Gaming Association (AGA) should have standing to participate at a future time to determine if PokerStars should be granted a brick and mortar casino license in New Jersey.</p>
<p>The matter was scheduled to be heard at the regular monthly meeting of the Commission, who ultimately make the decisions. Information spread quietly Tuesday evening that the question for standing would not be addressed, but the matter remained on the formal agenda. When it came time for what would normally be the presentation of each side to be heard, it was simply read into the record as &#8220;adjourned&#8221;, without further discussion or explanation.</p>
<p>Last week the AGA filed a petition to be heard to voice their opposition, either by oral or written argument, at such time that a hearing takes place for the determination of whether to grant PokerStars an Interim Casino Authorization, which is the necessary temporary license required to run a casino in Atlantic City. They also filed a brief to support their position that the lobby group has standing to participate.  The Rational Group (for PokerStars) filed an opposing brief, citing that the AGA &#8216;s claims do not fit the criteria for standing as a matter of law.</p>
<p>Both sides will be able to present arguments before the commission in support of their positions and the Division of Gaming Enforcement (DGE) will likely also be heard.  The decision as to standing will rest with the Commission.</p>
<p>One attorney for the Casino control commission told Diamond Flush Poker that the last minute decision for adjournment was solely at the discretion of the commissioners. When asked, DGE offered this reporter no further information as to the reason for the delay, or when it might be rescheduled, except to say that they had not filed a brief as to the matter.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the Casino Control Commission said the adjournment was called for  &#8220;because more time was needed&#8221;.  Sources close to the situation say that the matter is expected to be heard and ruled upon in the next weeks.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>Last week, the <a href="http://www.americangaming.org/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.americangaming.org/', 'American Gaming Association']);" title="AGA"  target="_blank">American Gaming Association</a> (AGA) <a title="AGA brief to Deny PokerStars a casino license" href="http://diamondflushpoker.com/2013/03/american-gaming-association-files-petition-to-bar-pokerstars-from-atlantic-city/" target="_blank">filed a brief </a>with the New Jersey Casino Control Commission, asserting that PokerStars was not &#8220;qualified&#8221; to receive an Interim Casino Authorization in Atlantic City.  The lobby group also filed a petition to <a title="AGA wants standing" href="http://diamondflushpoker.com/2013/03/the-aga-attempts-to-flex-their-muscles-in-new-jersey-pokerstars-pushes-back/" target="_blank">assert their standing</a> to participate in the hearings where the decision to grant the ICA will be heard.</p>
<p>According to sources, PokerStars has now filed their own brief to ask that the AGA petition to participate be denied for lack of standing.  While the AGA claims that the issue involves not only public interest but additional private interest by basis of their membership.  The PokerStars petition to deny standing to the AGA in the matter asserts that the AGA has not identified any concrete interest in the sale or operation of the Atlantic Club Casino, which is the matter at hand. The petition to deny also states that since the AGA brings no firsthand information before the Commission other than what is available from public sources widely available to anyone with any interest, that they lack the requisite standing. The Casino Control Commission and the Division of Gaming Enforcement are keenly already aware of the same information without requiring the input of the AGA.   <a href="http://diamondflushpoker.com/2013/03/pokerstars-files-brief-to-nj-commission-aga-lacks-standing-to-participate-in-casino-authorization-decision/#more-3594" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>Yesterday, the American Gaming Association <a title="AGA files petition to keep PokerStars from New Jersey" href="http://diamondflushpoker.com/2013/03/american-gaming-association-files-petition-to-bar-pokerstars-from-atlantic-city/" target="_blank">(AGA), filed a petition with</a> the New Jersey Department of Gaming Enforcement (DGE) to ask that New Jersey deny a casino license to PokerStars. PokerStars is in the process of acquiring the Atlantic Club Casino in Atlantic City, and filed their application for the appropriate interim casino authorization license in late December.</p>
<p>The AGA also filed a brief summarizing their position that they have standing in the case, to be heard via the aforementioned petition and, if standing is granted, they asked for leave to take part in oral or written arguments following the hearing in Atlantic City to determine if the license for PokerStars will be granted.</p>
<p>In the AGA&#8217;s brief in support of its petition to participate in the matter, they claim to represent the interest of 62 members with interests relating to the commercial casino industry, including casino companies, gaming equipment manufacturers, financial services companies, professional services firms, suppliers and vendors, state gaming associations, publications and labor unions.</p>
<p>Of particular note, the brief asserts that the AGA has &#8220;consistently favored the preservation of suitability based licensing criteria for the commercial casino industry and recognized the necessity of insuring that only individuals and entities of good reputation and integrity are licensed&#8221;.      <a href="http://diamondflushpoker.com/2013/03/the-aga-attempts-to-flex-their-muscles-in-new-jersey-pokerstars-pushes-back/#more-3585" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

				<p>Disputing that the petitioners for a PokerStars interim casino license in Atlantic City, New Jersey, both individual and corporate, are qualified under the Interim Casino Authorization (ICA) via N.J.S.A. 5:2-95.12 of the Casino Control Act, the American Gaming Association, (AGA) filed a <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/1GQKlgYbWyxYklI_86nEtp3-mdd68pXeCEr7QOsF2Kk0ib7HoLT2dILi8vqWJ/edit?usp=sharing" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://docs.google.com/file/d/1GQKlgYbWyxYklI_86nEtp3-mdd68pXeCEr7QOsF2Kk0ib7HoLT2dILi8vqWJ/edit?usp=sharing', 'petition ']);" title="AGA petition to Bar PokerStars from NJ"  target="_blank">petition </a>on Monday asking the Division of Gaming Enforcement to deny the application for the license.</p>
<p>The petition was filed late in the day Monday with the DGE, signed by attorneys for the AGA, is an effort by its membership, to convince regulators in New Jersey that PokerStars is &#8220;not suitable&#8221; for licensing. The petition asserts that licensing of PokerStars in N.J. would &#8220;gravely compromise the integrity of the gaming industry&#8221; and that PokerStars business is one built on &#8220;deceit, chicanery and the systematic flouting of U.S. law&#8221;.</p>
<p>The petition further asserts that licensing of the applicant would &#8220;send a damaging message to the world of gaming, and to the world beyond gaming that companies that engage in chronic lawbreaking are welcome in the licensed gaming business&#8221;. According to the AGA&#8217;s position in their petition, such a message &#8221; would dramatically undermine public confidence in gaming regulation and could cripple the industry&#8217;s public image for many years&#8221;.   <a href="http://diamondflushpoker.com/2013/03/american-gaming-association-files-petition-to-bar-pokerstars-from-atlantic-city/#more-3578" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>
