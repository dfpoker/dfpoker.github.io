		<description><![CDATA[The refund process is bullshit.
My husband and I deposited $100 the DAY BEFORE the shit hit the fan and never even got the chance to play with real money on Full Tilt!!!!
We are owed $100 with no physical proof (according to full tilt standards) of our deposit.  Shouldn&#039;t there be some kind of listing showing our participation on their books?]]></description>
