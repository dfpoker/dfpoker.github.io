		<description><![CDATA[Just finished reading, very interesting. Here is what I am torn over... The missing money, was it just forfeitures, seizures, thefts, and bad investments that led them to have less money than needed to cover player liability? Or we&#039;re HL, RB and possibly the other board member stealing money, and if so, where did that money go? Seems to me like there are 2 different levels of scumbag, and idk which HL should be labeled. Did they make a bad mistake approving deposits that they would never be able to receive and that, coupled with thefts, seizures and apparently investing in other companies (the article touched on the fact that RB was named the head of several business associated with FTP, but never goes into what those businesses were. Were they legit investments that didn&#039;t pan out? Were they just a way to funnel money?)  cause them to be that far under in terms of cash on hand? Or did HL, RB and the other board members steal money from the site knowingly out of greed? To live the $200,000 a month lobster habit DN refers to in his rant? Seems like the former is somewhat forgivable in that a bad decision (crediting accounts before the deposit goes through) coupled with the US government shutting down the site before potential new payment processors could start to cut into the backlog, is more of mistake and the latter ought to have (at least) HL and RB shunned from the community. And if HL were just a good man that mad a big mistake, why didn&#039;t he offer up any of his money for transition 2.0? I remember reading he received more than $40 million over the years with FTP. In the end, I am left feeling like HL got off easily in this case, and my opinion of him has changed 180 degrees since watching him on tv in the early 2000s. But I am left with some reservations, what happened to all the embezzled money and why knowingly steal if you are getting paid $1 million a month? Please, if you can, she&#039;d some light as I am not the brightest bulb in the shed. Thanks.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The refund process is bullshit.
My husband and I deposited $100 the DAY BEFORE the shit hit the fan and never even got the chance to play with real money on Full Tilt!!!!
We are owed $100 with no physical proof (according to full tilt standards) of our deposit.  Shouldn&#039;t there be some kind of listing showing our participation on their books?]]></description>

With a 23 page decision released less than two months post-argument, seems the court had this case all but decided prior to argument.]]></description>
