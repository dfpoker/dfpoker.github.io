						<p><a href="http://diamondflushpoker.com/2012/02/campos-and-elie-submit-briefs-re-wire-act-opinion/scales_of_justice2/" rel="attachment wp-att-2645"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-2645" title="Scales of Justice" src="http://diamondflushpoker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Scales_of_justice2.jpg" alt="" width="253" height="255" /></a>The question whether the jury can hear evidence to decide if internet poker is covered by UIGEA and IGBA, and whether defendants Chad Elie and John Campos can argue a &#8220;good faith&#8221; or &#8220;advice of counsel&#8221; defense, is now in the hands of Judge Lewis Kaplan, who is presiding over the Black Friday criminal trial in New York.  At a January pre-trial conference, both the government and defense suggested that these issues would need to be resolved by the court prior to jury selection.  A ruling by the court in either direction would affect opening statements, the possible testimony of expert witnesses, jury instructions and the tone of the trial in general.  The defense and the government submitted their <em><a title="Elie, Campos and SDNY present motions in limine to the Court" href="http://diamondflushpoker.com/2012/02/elie-campos-jury-should-decide-if-poker-is-unlawful-gambling-sdny-its-the-courts-job-as-a-matter-of-law/" target="_blank">motions in limine</a></em>  to the court last week, and their responses are now on the record as well.</p>
<span id="Government_Response"><h2>Government Response</h2></span>
<p>The government maintains it&#8217;s <a href="https://docs.google.com/open?id=0BxNSLF3qCn56MENsbVVSWlhSR2lPdy14amlIamxpdw" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://docs.google.com/open?id=0BxNSLF3qCn56MENsbVVSWlhSR2lPdy14amlIamxpdw', 'stance']);" title="Government response1 to motions in limine"  target="_blank">stance</a> that the level of skill in online poker is irrelevant from an evidentiary standpoint. While prosecutors apparently agree with the defense motion that each offense element is a matter for the jury as the triers of fact, they contend it is a jump for the defense to then say that <a href="http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/uscode/18/I/95/1955" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/uscode/18/I/95/1955', 'IGBA']);" title="IGBA"  target="_blank">IGBA</a> and <a href="http://www.pokerxanadu.com/pokerlaw/uigea.pdf" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','download','http://www.pokerxanadu.com/pokerlaw/uigea.pdf']);" title="UIGEA"  target="_blank">UIGEA</a> contain offense elements which depend on whether skill or luck &#8220;predominates&#8221; in poker, since the government contends that underlying state gambling law clearly does apply to poker.       <span id="more-2744"></span></p>
<p>In addition, the government points to the court&#8217;s previous denial of pre-trial motions to dismiss where the &#8220;Court has already explained, an &#8220;<em>illegal gambling business</em>&#8221; under IGBA &#8220;is defined in relevant part as a gambling business which (i) is a violation of the law of a State . . . in which it is conducted.&#8221;  <sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-2744-1' id='fnref-2744-1' onclick='return fdfootnote_show(2744)'>1</a></sup></p>
<p>The government further takes issue with defense position that in order for poker to be included under the IGBA statute, it should be, at least, similar to the &#8220;non-exhaustive list&#8221; of IGBA&#8217;s nine named activities.<sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-2744-2' id='fnref-2744-2' onclick='return fdfootnote_show(2744)'>2</a></sup>  The response states that the defense&#8217;s assertion that the list of stated games in IGBA creates a factual element of the offense that would be a matter for the jury, is &#8220;unhinged from logic&#8221;. Further, says the government, expecting a jury to decide anew in each case whether the stated game in a charge meets the federal definition of gambling &#8220;is as unworkable as it is unsupported&#8221;. Since the defense have stated no parameters, says the response, as to the substance or the degree of parity for the jury to make such a determination in each separate case, while setting no precedent for the next case, such determinations &#8220;would lead to substantial variance and unpredictability as to IGBA‟s scope&#8221;.</p>
<p>The government also points out that  the defense provided no instance, in over 40 years of IGBA prosecutions,where the court instructed the jury to contemplate whether the activity charged met some common ground with the nine examples used in the non-exhaustive list of IGBA&#8217;s definitions as an element of the defense. Instead, the government contends that juries have consistently been advised that gambling for purposes of IGBA is treated as gambling for state law. From the book &#8220;Modern Federal Jury Instructions&#8221; <sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-2744-3' id='fnref-2744-3' onclick='return fdfootnote_show(2744)'>3</a></sup>, government points to a section of jury instructions cited from United States v. Perrone et al.,05Cr. 774 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) (KJM). The partial jury instructions can be seen in government <a href="https://docs.google.com/open?id=0BxNSLF3qCn56TXVsMmk4WEJUWXVoaU9BcHJTR1BWQQ" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://docs.google.com/open?id=0BxNSLF3qCn56TXVsMmk4WEJUWXVoaU9BcHJTR1BWQQ', 'Exhibit A']);" title="Government response attachment Exhibit A"  target="_blank">Exhibit A</a>, and Judge Wood&#8217;s charge to the New York jury included:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The crime of conducting an illegal gambling business has three elements: First, that the business operated in violation of New York State Law. Second, that five or more persons knowingly conducted, financed, managed, supervised, directed or owned all or part of the business. Third, that the business remained in substantially continuous operation&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<p>The government response also takes issue with a defense position that the definition of gambling in UIGEA, which includes in part the definition of &#8220;bet or wager&#8221;, for example  <em>&#8220;the staking or risking by any person of something of value upon the outcome of a contest of others, a sporting event, or a game subject to chance, upon an agreement or understanding that the person or another person will receive something of value in the event of a certain outcome&#8221;,</em> means &#8220;a game predominantly subject to chance&#8221;.</p>
<p>While the government agrees that &#8220;subject to chance&#8221; means that chance would be a factor, there is no language in the statute to suggest that the intent of the wording of chance was to be a &#8220;predominant&#8221; factor, especially in light of the fact that the government asserts that amendments to earlier versions of the same bill deleted the &#8220;predominate&#8221; terminology.  The government also contends that while UIGEA was intentionally broad in its definition covering games &#8220;subject to chance&#8221;, that in no way means that the game needs to be construed as either &#8220;predominantly&#8221; skill or chance, but just includes the element of chance, as is apparent in the fact that random cards are dealt that, regardless of any skill involved, have an impact on the outcome. Finally, any evidence towards the questions of the predominance factor of skill in poker could still not address that the game is &#8220;subject to chance&#8221; and therefore should be excluded as to it&#8217;s relevancy as well as  <a href="http://expertpages.com/federal/a4.htm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://expertpages.com/federal/a4.htm', 'Rule 403']);" title="Rule 403"  target="_blank">Rule 403</a> grounds. <sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-2744-4' id='fnref-2744-4' onclick='return fdfootnote_show(2744)'>4</a></sup></p>
<p>The government asserts that both UIGEA and IGBA are &#8220;general intent&#8221; statutes and therefore leave no option for a &#8220;good faith&#8221; or &#8220;advice of counsel&#8221; defense as might be proffered by the &#8220;<a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BxNSLF3qCn56ZTdaVmc2NGFSeTZDWW1pZkVHbzA2QQ/edit" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BxNSLF3qCn56ZTdaVmc2NGFSeTZDWW1pZkVHbzA2QQ/edit', 'legal opinions']);" title="Legal Opinions from Govt motion in limine"  target="_blank">legal opinions</a>&#8221; the defense may move to admit . The response further states that even if a factual basis existed for such a defense, that such evidence would intrude on the court&#8217;s instructions to the jury as a matter of law, as well as being &#8220;unfairly prejudicial, misleading and confusing to the jury&#8221;.</p>
<p>The government states that courts have always held that IGBA is a general intent statute and that there are no court of appeals decisions to the contrary and that the statute also states no specific <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mens_rea" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mens_rea', 'mens rea']);" title="Mens rea standard"  target="_blank">mens rea</a> </em>requirement<em>.</em></p>

In lateral argument with the current case, the response states that this ruling would therefore not have permitted a defense that the defendant was unaware that ownership of the machine gun was illegal or that he had received some opinion from the manufacturer that such possession of the gun was not unlawful, (i.e. the poker company <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BxNSLF3qCn56ZTdaVmc2NGFSeTZDWW1pZkVHbzA2QQ/edit" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BxNSLF3qCn56ZTdaVmc2NGFSeTZDWW1pZkVHbzA2QQ/edit', 'legal opinions']);" title="Govt Exhibit of Poker Company Legal Opinions"  target="_blank">legal opinions</a>).</p>

While the government&#8217;s <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BxNSLF3qCn56Y2Z2Y3dQNXBSZ0s3YTdON1BiaDhpZw/edit" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BxNSLF3qCn56Y2Z2Y3dQNXBSZ0s3YTdON1BiaDhpZw/edit', 'motion in limine']);" title="Government motion in limine"  target="_blank">motion in limine</a> called these opinions &#8220;self-serving&#8221;, being addressed to and received from the poker companies, the defense points out that the opinions were significant, in and of themselves, in part based on their authorship. One was an opinion from the firm Ashcroft Hanaway addressed to SunFirst Bank. Ashcroft Hanaway is the law firm of former United States Attorney General John Ashcroft and Catherine Hanaway, the former United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Missouri. In fact Ms. Hanaway actually had testified before Congress regarding UIGEA and had initiated one of the leading prosecutions on Internet gambling.</p>
<p>The defense also points out that both Elie and Campos received additional opinions regarding the lawfulness of the financial transaction types in question. Those opinions were authored by Marc Zwillinger,of Sonnenschein Nath &amp; Rosenthal LLP, a former federal prosecutor experienced in online gaming law, Ian Imrich, a specialist in online gaming, and Tom Goldstein of Akin Gump <sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-2744-10' id='fnref-2744-10' onclick='return fdfootnote_show(2744)'>10</a></sup>Strauss Hauer and Feld, LLP.  <sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-2744-11' id='fnref-2744-11' onclick='return fdfootnote_show(2744)'>11</a></sup></p>
<p>The defense further contends that the government&#8217;s motion, while describing that Elie neglected to follow up with authorities following the 2009 seizures of approximately $ 8.6 million in processing bank accounts, failed to make note that Elie did take part in two proffer sessions with the aim to recover the seized funds and obtain a non-prosecution agreement.</p>
<p>In as much as the government called the legal opinions &#8220;self-serving&#8221; as some of them may have come via the poker companies, the defense points out that not only were the opinions not penned by the poker companies, they were authored by well respected attorneys, including former D.O.J. officials, in accordance with standards that require attorneys to exercise their independent judgment.  <sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-2744-12' id='fnref-2744-12' onclick='return fdfootnote_show(2744)'>12</a></sup>  Furthermore, in accordance with Model Rules of Professional Conduct, <a href="http://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_2_3_evaluation_for_use_by_third_persons.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_2_3_evaluation_for_use_by_third_persons.html', 'Rule 2.3 ']);" title="Model Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 2.3"  target="_blank">Rule 2.3 </a> attorneys are authorized to  provide their opinions to non-clients. Finally, not only can Elie and Campos acquire such opinions, they are recommended to do so by the government agency that issued the rules for the implementation of UIGEA. Defense includes copy from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Compliance Guide to Small Entities, Regulation GG, (<a href="https://docs.google.com/open?id=0BxNSLF3qCn56eDMyNGhudG5Ua2llTTBDdTl2TjllQQ" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://docs.google.com/open?id=0BxNSLF3qCn56eDMyNGhudG5Ua2llTTBDdTl2TjllQQ', 'Exhibit B']);" title="Federal Reserve Reg, GG, Exhibit B"  target="_blank">Exhibit B</a>),  which, in part, states that businesses involved with processing payments for commercial customers without Internet gambling licenses :</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="LEFT"> &#8220;should obtain from the commercial customer a reasoned legal opinion from the commercial customer&#8217;s legal counsel that demonstrates that the commercial customer&#8217;s Internet gambling business does not involve transactions that are prohibited by UIGEA&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="LEFT">The characterization of the opinions by the government notwithstanding, the defense contends that the opinions be permitted as evidence when the defense challenges the government&#8217;s proof of all elements of the charges, UIGEA, IGBA and money laundering, as to defendant&#8217;s good faith belief that their conduct was lawful.</p>
<p align="LEFT">With respect to the evidentiary value of online poker being a game &#8220;subject to chance&#8221;,  the defense response contends that the government ignores the offense elements in UIGEA  where the statute says the conduct must constitute a &#8220;game subject to chance&#8221;, and IGBA where the requirement is that the game is &#8220;gambling, by claiming the charges must only withstand the test in the underlying state laws. According to the response, the defense says that the jury must first find that UIGEA applies, before addressing any state laws. In fact, says the defense, the government concedes such, by having stated that UIGEA:</p>
<p align="LEFT">&#8220;applies to any games that are &#8216;subject to chance,&#8217; . . .<em>and</em> that are prohibited under the law of the state in which the &#8216;bet or wager is initiated, received, or otherwise made.&#8221; <sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-2744-13' id='fnref-2744-13' onclick='return fdfootnote_show(2744)'>13</a></sup></p>
<p align="LEFT">For <a href="http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/uscode/18/I/95/1955" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/uscode/18/I/95/1955', 'IGBA']);" title="IGBA"  target="_blank">IGBA</a> as well, the defense states, the jury must determine that the conduct alleged is &#8220;gambling&#8221; before ever evaluating whether a state statute has been violated. For clarity, the response reiterates that section b(2) :</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="LEFT">&#8220;&#8216;gambling&#8217; includes but is not limited to pool-selling, bookmaking, maintaining slot machines, roulette wheels or dice tables, and conducting lotteries, policy, bolita or numbers games, or selling chances therein&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="LEFT">defines the activities that constitute &#8220;gambling&#8221; when carried out by businesses meeting sections (b)(1)(i)-(iii):  &#8220;illegal gambling business&#8221; means a gambling business which</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="LEFT">(i) is a violation of the law of a State or political subdivision in which it is conducted;</p>
<p align="LEFT">(ii) involves five or more persons who conduct, finance, manage, supervise, direct, or own all or part of such business; and</p>
<p align="LEFT">(iii) has been or remains in substantially continuous operation for a period in excess of thirty days or has a gross revenue of $2,000 in any single day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To counter government&#8217;s argument that IGBA uses the terminology &#8220;includes but is not limited to&#8221; and therefore can and should include poker, defense points to <a href="http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-2nd-circuit/1120716.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-2nd-circuit/1120716.html', 'Malloy v Metropolitan Transportation Authority']);" title="Malloy v Metro Trans.

<p>The defense repeats from their motion, citing  <a href="http://law.onecle.com/ussc/515/515us506.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://law.onecle.com/ussc/515/515us506.html', 'U.S. v Gaudin']);" title="US v Gaudin SCOTUS"  target="_blank">U.S. v Gaudin</a> and  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apprendi_v._New_Jersey" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apprendi_v._New_Jersey', 'Apprendi v N.J.']);" title="Apprendi v NJ SCOTUS"  target="_blank">Apprendi v N.J.</a> where the Supreme Court held that &#8220;every element of a criminal statute requires separate determination by the jury&#8221;. Further, even when the government argues that the evidence to an offense element is strong, it  must still be determined by the jury. <sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-2744-14' id='fnref-2744-14' onclick='return fdfootnote_show(2744)'>14</a></sup></p>
<p>In February 2012, according to the response, the Second Circuit confirmed again that the question of whether online poker meets the definition under statute is the question for the jury, not the court, as the triers of fact. In <a href="https://docs.google.com/open?id=0BxNSLF3qCn56cVZ5RHFpRmFTNmVQdnVZTkM2XzVlQQ" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://docs.google.com/open?id=0BxNSLF3qCn56cVZ5RHFpRmFTNmVQdnVZTkM2XzVlQQ', 'United States v.

Feb. 22, 2012), the court vacated the conviction when the trial court took the decision whether the &#8220;hawala&#8221; intermediary used by the family qualified as a money transmitting business away from the jury .</p>
<p>Further, the government&#8217;s argument that UIGEA was meant to include poker is unsupported by any record and would be only relevant if the jury were to find that online poker qualifies as a &#8220;game subject to chance&#8221;.  Likewise, the government&#8217;s assertion that the word &#8220;predominance&#8221; was removed from HR 4177 <sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-2744-15' id='fnref-2744-15' onclick='return fdfootnote_show(2744)'>15</a></sup>when drafting UIGEA to purposely include poker, is not substantiated in any way via committee reports or statements of sponsors of either bill. <sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-2744-16' id='fnref-2744-16' onclick='return fdfootnote_show(2744)'>16</a></sup></p>
<p>Finally, the defendant&#8217;s &#8220;good faith&#8221; and lack of knowledge is relevant. Both UIGEA and IGBA do require proof of &#8220;knowing&#8221; conduct. The response claims that the government has conceded this by their statement in their motion, namely that the government must prove &#8220;defendant&#8217;s knowledge of the facts comprising the offense.&#8221; The facts comprising the offenses charged in UIGEA and IGBA require that poker is a &#8220;game subject to chance&#8221; and &#8216;gambling. Therefore, says the response, the defendants should be entitled to challenge any proof that they knew the game was &#8220;subject to chance&#8221; or had those  &#8220;characteristics&#8221; , see <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=case&amp;court=us&amp;vol=511+&amp;page=600" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=case&amp;court=us&amp;vol=511+&amp;page=600', ' Staples v.

Ct.</span>1793, 1802 (1994),  that make it gambling under IGBA.</p>
<p>As previously stated, proof of the &#8220;facts constituting the offense&#8221; requires both the knowledge that poker was a game of &#8220;chance&#8221; and also that online poker constituted &#8220;unlawful&#8221; internet gambling. UIGEA specifically provides that defendants must know that their activity qualifies as &#8220;unlawful internet gambling&#8221; and as can be noted in the UIGEA jury instructions,  (<a href="https://docs.google.com/open?id=0BxNSLF3qCn56dkllbHdsaEJSbXVZTXAzR0lSd29hZw" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://docs.google.com/open?id=0BxNSLF3qCn56dkllbHdsaEJSbXVZTXAzR0lSd29hZw', 'Exhibit 4']);" title="Jury Instructions, Exhibit 4, US v Lyons"  target="_blank">Exhibit 4</a>  see page 69-70, re United States v. Lyons, 10 <span style="font-family: Times-Roman;">CR 10159 ,D. Mass.</span>Dec. 15, 2011) &#8220;defendants must know that certain activities were prohibited by law&#8221; and that the jury may consider whether &#8220;defendant acted with a good faith belief that his actions complied with the law&#8221;.</p>
<p>The court should further disregard the government&#8217;s reliance on <a href="http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-2nd-circuit/1302088.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-2nd-circuit/1302088.html', 'United States v. Cohen']);" title="U.S. v Cohen 2nd Circuit"  target="_blank">United States v. Cohen</a>, 260 F.3d 68 (2d Cir. 2001) because Cohen addressed a violation of the Wire Act, which does not require knowledge of the illegality of the underlying conduct, unlike UIGEA.</p>
<p>Regarding the money laundering charge, the response states that the government has taken no serious stance to argue that defendants would not be entitled to present a &#8220;good faith&#8221; and lack of knowledge defense and instead has only misstated the wording from the statute itself in a footnote, or cited a challenged jury charge as unnecessary in light of a stipulation between both parties of the case.</p>
<p>Lastly, the government&#8217;s argument re an &#8220;advice of counsel&#8221; defense are moot, because the defendants are asserting no such defense. The defense intention to request to present evidence, including  the &#8220;legal opinions&#8221;  would be to show that they had no knowledge of the essential elements of the offenses, namely that online poker was a game &#8220;subject to chance&#8221; and &#8221; unlawful internet gambling&#8221; under UIGEA or &#8220;gambling&#8221; as defined under IGBA. While the government can argue the strength of the evidence, including the legal opinions, that should have no bearing on the admissibility of any evidence of &#8220;facts that informed their knowledge and influenced their state of mind.</p>
<p>The government&#8217;s argument that the jury will not be able to follow the court&#8217;s legal instructions is speculative at best and should not outweigh the significant probative value of defendant&#8217;s knowledge and state of mind, especially with limiting instruction. This very court allowed the government to present documents that contained legal conclusions in U.S. v Stein et al, and stated that there was &#8220;no reason to think that the jury could not follow limiting instructions with respect to any statement in documents that may be admitted or that it would not scrupulously adhere to the Court&#8217;s instructions at the close of the evidence.&#8221; See Berke <a href="https://docs.google.com/open?id=0BxNSLF3qCn56ZU5zcTctSnhRSmE5endKRURVWm1lQQ" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://docs.google.com/open?id=0BxNSLF3qCn56ZU5zcTctSnhRSmE5endKRURVWm1lQQ', 'Exhibit C ']);" title="Exhibit C Jury Instructions"  target="_blank">Exhibit C </a> with jury instructions.</p>

<li id='fn-2744-4'> The fact that over the long term the role of “chance” in any one poker player‟s success will diminish the more he or she plays is a meaningless mathematical truism that applies to players of any game with any non-zero degree of skill. For example, in a hypothetical coin toss game where one time out of one hundred skill can influence the toss, skill predominates in the long run because the variance of chance will over time be distributed evenly among participants such that the effect of skill is magnified. But UIGEA addresses whether the game – which in poker is denominated by a hand – is “subject to chance,” not whether at some point an individual player‟s long-term results will ultimately be derived more from his skill.

<li id='fn-2744-16'> Incidental statements by the Federal Reserve and Department of Treasury suggesting that there may be some significance to the inclusion of the word &#8220;predominantly&#8221; in 31 U.S.C. § 5362(1)(B), are not the sort of lawmaking authority that entitle their views to deference since the agencies affirmatively declined to adopt a definition of a &#8220;game subject to chance&#8221; by rule or regulation. See United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U.S. 218, 226-27, 121 S. Ct. 2164, 2171 (2001). See also §5362(1)(C), which does not diminish or alter the scope of §5362(1)(A) with respect to sports betting, just as the word &#8220;predominantly&#8221; in §5362(1)(B) does not diminish or alter the term &#8220;game subject to chance&#8221; in §5362(1)(A). Indeed, even the agencies recognized that there will be some games that do not qualify as &#8220;games subject to chance&#8221; and noted that &#8220;the characterization of {each activity} depends on the specific facts and circumstances.&#8221; Prohibition on Funding of Unlawful Internet Gambling, 73 Fed. Reg. 69,382, 69,386, 2008 WL 4915226 (Nov. 18, 2008). Contrary to the government&#8217;s position, Gov&#8217;t Br. 11-12, the record also shows that the April 5, 2006 statements of Department of Justice representative Bruce Ohr did not have any influence on Congress. Ohr testified about a wholly separate bill (an amendment to the Wire Act), which included the word predominantly both before and after his comments. Compare H.R. 4777, 109th Cong. § 1081(6)(A) (Feb. 16, 2006), with H.R. 4777, 109th Cong. § 1081(6)(A) (as reported by Comm. on the Judiciary, May 25, 2006). As for UIGEA, neither the initial bill prior to Ohr&#8217;s testimony nor its final enactment included the word predominantly. Compare H.R. 4411, 109th Cong. § 5362(I)(A) (Nov. 18, 2005), with 18 U.S.C. § 5362(1)(A) (enacted Oct. 13, 2006). Finally, the government&#8217;s arguments about the 1999 National Gambling Impact Study are similarly misplaced. See Elie&#8217;s Mem. of Law in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss the UIGEA Counts at 14-15. <span class='footnotereverse'><a href='#fnref-2744-16'>&#8617;</a></span></li>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Long reads, these are <img src="http://diamondflushpoker.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />  However, I find it interesting and appreciate you doing these as I don&#8217;t have the time to go through the actual court papers.  This summarizes them well and allows me to follow along.</p>
<p>Really pulling for the defendants here and I&#8217;m surprised at how strong a defense they have and continue to put up and hopefully I&#8217;m not looking at this through rose colored glasses, but if they can get these heard by a jury, I&#8217;d like to think a jury of our peers will see the difference between poker and &#8220;gambling&#8221;.  It is significant, I think,   that the UIGEA never specifically mentions poker.</p>
