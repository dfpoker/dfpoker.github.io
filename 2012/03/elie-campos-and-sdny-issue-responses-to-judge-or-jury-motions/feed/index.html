		<description><![CDATA[Long reads, these are :)  However, I find it interesting and appreciate you doing these as I don&#039;t have the time to go through the actual court papers.  This summarizes them well and allows me to follow along.

Really pulling for the defendants here and I&#039;m surprised at how strong a defense they have and continue to put up and hopefully I&#039;m not looking at this through rose colored glasses, but if they can get these heard by a jury, I&#039;d like to think a jury of our peers will see the difference between poker and &quot;gambling&quot;.  It is significant, I think,   that the UIGEA never specifically mentions poker.]]></description>
