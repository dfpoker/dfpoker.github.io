		<description><![CDATA[Absolutely chicken shit to offer a man charged with 9 felonies a plea to charge to one misdemeanor.  Some &quot;justice&quot; there is in the Dept Of Justice.  Nah, we can&#039;t risk being proven wrong in a court, and since we dont really care about Justice anyway, let&#039;s just make an offer these guys can&#039;t refuse.  We still got all that money we seized and we get them to plead guilty.

Makes me sick.]]></description>
