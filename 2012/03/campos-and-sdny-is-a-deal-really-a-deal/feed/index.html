		<description><![CDATA[Very good saga.  Maybe we will still end up seeing how the judge rules on the pretrial motions.  Don&#039;t see any hope that the USAO can get the alleged criminal activity of Elie admitted.  I doubt their selected venue would admit evidence in re poker skill, but apparently they are even afraid of that.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sorry to go off at a tangent here, but this case, and the overall situation with poker in the U.S.A. highlight some of the huge problems there.

I&#039;m not American, in fact I live in an ex-Soviet state and corruption is part of life here. But all this official corruption in the US is shocking to me. Is nobody trying to deal with the wider issues? Bullshit like plea bargaining, piggy-back bill passing, lobbying (aka bribery), how big corporations that have failed to get off their asses can just buy protectionist legislation for themselves. 

Are Americans too materially comfortable to rail against the machine?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[LOL, so much win in this.  I want to copy/paste a couple gold quotes but it&#039;s short enough so I&#039;ll just savor it by reading it again.  Unreal, if this didn&#039;t actually happen, I&#039;d have trouble believing it :)]]></description>
