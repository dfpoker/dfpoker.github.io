Further, defense claims the government neglected for almost a year, despite being a request from the defense, to provide the necessary notice that they planned to pursue such an avenue of  evidence relating to the alleged &#8220;dubious or illegal&#8221; nature  of Elie&#8217;s  business practices.  Finally, says Elie, while the government &#8220;may be concerned that the jury will question the wisdom and merits of a prosecution about online poker&#8221;, and the government may fear &#8220;jury nullification&#8221;, the defense will only be producing evidence that conforms to the court&#8217;s rulings as to the skill involved in poker and the <em><a title="mens rea" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mens_rea" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mens_rea']);" target="_blank">mens rea</a></em> requirements of the charges, so asking the court to preclude certain evidence is premature, especially in light that Elie has no intentions of using prosecutorial motivations or jury nullification as part of the defense. Campos responds to the government&#8217;s motion,  that their plan to introduce a story of uncharged crimes &#8220;more nefarious than the charged crimes of unlawful processing of poker&#8221;, including alleged banking regulation violations, tax evasion, insider loans and theft from fellow bank investors, has no place in this trial, and has nothing to do with the charges in this case.         <span id="more-2804"></span></p>
<span id="Defense_Response"><h2>Defense Response</h2></span>
<span id="Chad_Elie:"><h3><a title="Elie response 2nd motions in limine" href="https://docs.google.com/open?id=0BxNSLF3qCn56dHZMcXlHdXlSakdrQ09taUVWRm00dw" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://docs.google.com/open?id=0BxNSLF3qCn56dHZMcXlHdXlSakdrQ09taUVWRm00dw']);" target="_blank">Chad Elie</a>:</h3></span>
<p>Elie&#8217;s response states that despite the fact that the government asserts that the only facts for the jury to determine will be whether the defendants committed the crimes they are charged with in this case (operating, aiding and abetting the operation of poker companies, conspiring to commit money laundering, bank and wire fraud), now the government wishes to introduce evidence that Elie engaged in unethical and misleading practices related to his internet marketing business, which have nothing to do with online poker. The government points to the alleged fraudulent practices committed by Jeremy Johnson and his internet marketing businesses. Whether those allegations about Johnson are valid or not, Elie&#8217;s partnership with Johnson included the poker processing at SunFirst and Elie played no role in Johnson&#8217;s internet marketing company, nor was he ever charged or referenced in any way in the indictments against Johnson. Johnson&#8217;s activities in his own internet marketing company have no relevance in this case.</p>
<p>Elie&#8217;s response further points out that that it is too late for the government to try to &#8220;interject new and unspecified allegations of fraud&#8221; into this case. The defense requested <a title="Federal Rules of Evidence 404" href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_404" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_404']);" target="_blank">404(b) </a>notice on April 19, 2011 and never received any notice that such a line of evidence was being contemplated. Even with new attorneys for Elie taking over just three months ago, new counsel was also never informed of government&#8217;s intent, including numerous telephone calls and letters between the government and defense counsel, even as late as February 2012. The first time that counsel was &#8220;advised&#8221; of the intent of the government to introduce Elie&#8217;s marketing practices was only through their motion in limine, only 3 weeks before trial is scheduled to begin, which is too late and too incomplete to satisfy Rule 404(b).</p>
<p>Elie&#8217;s response also points out that in the 3 months that new counsel was secured, they have been reviewing over 1.5 million documents of discovery. In addition, it was only 3 weeks before start of trial that defense received all the 90,000 documents relating to Daniel Tzvetkoff materials from the government, since finding out that so many documents were missing from the Intabill server that had been previously supplied via discovery requirements. <sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-2804-1' id='fnref-2804-1'>1</a></sup></p>
<p>Such late notice to the defense, aside from being lacking in detail, leaves the defense at a severe disadvantage. With only 3 weeks left prior to trial, defense would need to still identify what additional individuals and entities to subpoena and evidence needed to rebut the government claims. The notice requirement of 404(b) was clearly intended to avoid exactly this type of ambush. <sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-2804-2' id='fnref-2804-2'>2</a></sup></p>
<p>Even if the notice were timely, the government, by not offering any &#8220;coherent explanation&#8221; of how such evidence related to Elie&#8217;s &#8220;motive, opportunity and state of mind&#8221; makes the evidence still inadmissible under 404(b).</p>
<p>Defense also reiterates its position that the introduction of the alleged $ 4 million theft of PokerStars money should not be admissible for either background or motive purposes. Mr. Elie believed these funds were under the control of Curtis Pope and his companies. The fact that the same companies also owed money to PokerStars, then wrongly concluding that Elie &#8220;stole&#8221; the money from PokerStars, would still not be admissible as background because such evidence would not be required to establish the Elie had direct dealings with PokerStars in connection with the payment processing at SunFirst. There are numerous other pieces of evidence that are expected to be introduced that accomplish that same thing.  Even if there was a basis to admit the evidence of the $ 4 million dispute as background, doing so would risk unfair prejudice and should be excluded under <a title="Federal rules of Evidence Rule 403" href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_403" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_403']);" target="_blank">Rule 403</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, the government&#8217;s request that the court preclude the defense from offering any evidence about the popularity of poker and of people&#8217;s beliefs about poker is premature and unnecessary. The <em>mens rea</em> of the charges have already been stated in motions that are before the court. If the court decides that Elie&#8217;s good faith is relevant to any charges in the case, the defense should be allowed to present evidence about poker&#8217;s popularity and the prevalence of the game, the belief of others about its legality and all other facts that may have influenced his state of mind. Also, if any of Elie&#8217;s co-conspirators were called to testify for the government, defense should be able to cross examine these witnesses as to their belief on whether poker is a game of skill, and whether they believe(d) that online poker violates state or federal law. Defense is always permitted to impeach government witnesses about their states of mind at time of the alleged crimes.</p>
<p>The response states that while the government may be concerned that the jury will question the &#8220;wisdom and merits of a prosecution about online poker&#8221;, Elie does not intend to use jury nullification or prosecutorial motives as a defense.</p>
<span id="John_Campos:"><h3><a title="Campos response 2nd motions in limine" href="https://docs.google.com/open?id=0BxNSLF3qCn56Y0ExQVQ5dkdTNDIxVWRVRzZUT01QQQ" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://docs.google.com/open?id=0BxNSLF3qCn56Y0ExQVQ5dkdTNDIxVWRVRzZUT01QQQ']);" target="_blank">John Campos</a>:</h3></span>
<p>While the government alluded to Campos violating certain bank reporting regulations stemming from  the alleged inducement of investment of Elie and Johnson in SunFirst Bank by Campos, their motion never cites any such rules. Further, the offering of any evidence in this regard, does not meet the test that would allow &#8220;background&#8221; evidence, either that it is relevant or that it&#8217;s probative value outweighs it&#8217;s prejudicial value. Campos contends that introducing evidence of the alleged violations are of no consequence to  determining whether Campos violated any gambling laws by facilitating the payment transactions through SunFirst Bank. The government has not met their burden of establishing admissibility.</p>
<p>The fact that the government plans to introduce evidence of alleged wrongdoing by Campos with respect to the group of investors, Dixie Desert Investment Group, that Campos gathered to help SunFirst pay off a $5 million dollar note that had been called for payment, also has no bearing on the charges filed in this case. The government motion alleges multiple wrongs  committed by Campos, including theft, tax evasion, loans in violation of bank regulations, and false statements to regulators. While Campos would be able to prove these accusations false if necessary, at trial, such charges have no bearing on the charges of transparently processing payments for online poker companies as is charged. Such &#8220;evidence should be excluded as unduly prejudicial when it is more inflammatory than the charged crime&#8221;. <sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-2804-3' id='fnref-2804-3'>3</a></sup></p>
<p>The response also states that introducing evidence related to an FTC investigation into potential fraud involving Jeremy Johnson&#8217;s non-poker related transactions would again be highly prejudicial. Campos was never charged with fraud related to any such investigation, nor does the government even make any allegation that Campos knew that the FTC had contacted SunFirst about investigating Johnson. Any inference that Campos, by simple association with Johnson, could be also be guilty of charges eventually leveled against Johnson, would be highly prejudicial, especially since those charges against Johnson have no bearing of charges against Campos in this case.</p>
<p>Finally Campos asks the court to preclude any evidence related to the renewal of a $ 200,000 personal line of credit for Campos that occurred in 2010. Whether he should have been granted such credit in 2010, based on his ability to repay, has no bearing on the alleged conspiracy to bring poker processing transactions to SunFirst, which began well before any renewal of the credit line took place.</p>
<span id="Government_Response"><h2><a title="Govt response 2nd motions in limine" href="https://docs.google.com/open?id=0BxNSLF3qCn56b3l0MUlDTDdUMUt4UlRTY3A3Z0pzQQ" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://docs.google.com/open?id=0BxNSLF3qCn56b3l0MUlDTDdUMUt4UlRTY3A3Z0pzQQ']);" target="_blank">Government Response</a></h2></span>
<p>The government asks the court  that Elie&#8217;s motions to preclude the admissibility of his alleged theft of $ 4 million from PokerStars should be denied. The motion contends that in 2008, the collapse of Intabill began. At that time, National Bank of California, closed a processing account that they were no longer sure were being used to process  &#8220;payday loans&#8221; as they had been led to believe.  As Elie had been processing for Intabill, utilizing that bank account, he was one of the approved signatory names on the account.  After  removing other approved signers from the bank account, the government asserts that Elie, over the period of several months, transferred $ 4 million of the balance into his own bank accounts. Intabill sued Elie for the return of the money, and as Intabill allegedly owed PokerStars $ 4 million, the motion states that it was only through an agreement between Elie and Isai Scheinberg, the head of PokerStars, that the suit was settled.  The government contends that as part of this agreement, Elie agreed to aid PokerStars in finding new payment processing solutions, and hence introduced PokerStars to SunFirst Bank.</p>
<p>The motion states that this &#8220;theft is simply part of the story of the crime on trial&#8221;.  The government claims that this theft, and its resolution, happened in the middle of Elie&#8217;s processing for PokerStars, between 2008-2010. As such, the motion states that Elie&#8217;s actions during the course of this &#8220;spat&#8221; help to prove Elie&#8217;s motives, knowledge and intent, which is a requirement for the specific intent crime of conspiracy to commit bank and wire fraud with which he is charged. In addition, the motion states that because Elie did not report to the mafia threats to the police, and the fact that he continued to make arrangements with PokerStars to continue processing, as well as negotiating to keep half the $ 4 million, is evidence that he knew he was processing gambling transactions and that such gambling transactions were not legitimate.</p>
<p>Because the government must prove at trial that the underlying businesses were illegal (to meet the intent of the bank and wire fraud conspiracy charges), evidence that Elie and others freely &#8220;took whatever they pleased&#8221; from the poker companies&#8221;, lied to banks about the true nature of the processing accounts, and the fact that the &#8220;poker companies had little choice but to continue to work with those that had wronged them&#8221;, speaks not to the &#8220;character&#8221; of Elie, but the &#8220;nature of the co-conspirators business&#8221;. Therefore, the motion states, the prohibition of &#8220;character&#8221; evidence in <a title="Federal Rules of Evidence Rule 403" href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_403" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_403']);" target="_blank">Rule 403</a>, as put forth by the defense in its prior motion, would not apply.  As to defense argument that introduction of this evidence would unduly prolong the trial, the government disagrees, in as much as the principal witnesses to the theft, will be testifying anyway, precisely because the theft is so &#8220;inextricably intertwined&#8221; with the evidence of Elie&#8217;s relationship with PokerStars. Finally, the government asserts that because it expects the defense to offer evidence that Daniel Tzvetkoff himself owed tens of millions of dollars (of the more than $ 1 billion that Intabill processed) to PokerStars, it would be unfair to not allow the government to offer evidence that Elie, and others processors, also failed to pay.  The motion states that it is this fact, that everyone in the business, from Tzvetkoff through his sub-processors, took more money than was due, speaks to the nature of the illegal nature of the business.</p>
<p>The government response to the defense motion that introducing PartyGaming&#8217;s departure from the U.S. market after UIGEA would be unduly prejudicial, is that while there are no plans to introduce independent evidence of this, there could be limited testimony from a witness that discussed this fact with Elie, and that a given witness state of mind would be relevant as to the legality of gambling if it relied upon Party&#8217;s exit from the market.</p>
<p>The guilty plea of Anurag Dikshit in 2008, and his forfeiture of $300 million, and the non- prosecution agreement that the government reached with Party in 2009 where Party admitted to violating IGBA and agreed to a fine of $ 150 million, were well publicized in mainstream media, gambling industry news, blogs and online poker community forums. If a government witness were to testify about communications with Elie as to these events, then the evidence should be allowed as it speaks to Elie&#8217;s knowledge and intent.</p>
<p>The trial is scheduled to begin on April 9, 2012. Judge Kaplan&#8217;s rulings on all the <em>motions in limine</em> can come at any time.</p>
