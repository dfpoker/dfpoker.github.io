		<description><![CDATA[Superb article. AB comes across extremely well IMO. When Ivey&#039;s lawsuit was first announced there were rumblings of it being done for shady purposes. I think this interview further emphasizes what a scumbag Phil  Ivey really is. All that bs put out in his press release when in reality he was just angle shooting to try and further line his own coffers. I really hope this article is shared widely throughout the community so that people can  denounce this demi-god of poker.]]></description>
