		<description><![CDATA[With all respect, you say you will write &quot;what I believe Howard would have answered&quot; but you also say &quot;readers can decide for themselves.&quot;  Maybe leave out what you think he would&#039;ve answered because everything else is fact/objective and that is the only thing that isn&#039;t, so just a suggestion to leave it at facts and let the readers/forumers decide (they&#039;re pretty smart at figuring this stuff out =) ).  Thanks for all the hard work you&#039;ve put in on this!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I remember seeing howard talking about how he will not get closure until the player will get paid back in one of his last interview.

You know what ? I wont get closure for the year and half of pain (with a lot of my net worth locked in their scam) before the truth come out and he get in jail.

Thank you very much for helping with the former diamond.]]></description>
