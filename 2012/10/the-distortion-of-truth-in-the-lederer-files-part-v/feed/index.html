		<description><![CDATA[Howard has lost alot of weight. He used to be really fat. 

I wish that the gypsy women in the stephen King movie Thinner would come along and make a pie that would make Howard gain all of his weight back plus 400 pounds. Actually that he would just keep gaining weight until the literally exploded. 

Its amazing how easy it is for these scum of the earth to steal everyones money , live the high life, keep everything they stole and do a few stupid interviews where no hard questions where asked, and then show up in the poker community again, playing as if nothing happened. 

a few years back I was in a florida casino playing 2/5 NL when I heard a commotion at a table. Turns out Russ Hamilton showed up to play some 10/20NL and the guys at the table basically told him to ffff off and called him every name in the book and Fat ass Russ had to leave. As he was leaving he dropped his chip rack and the guys needling him started grabbing his chips and saying, dont worry we will give these back to the people you ripped off. That action got the 2 guys kicked out of the casino and Russ actually had the nerve to sit down and play after all that. 

Its just amazing to me the nerve of these vial idiots. they should be put in a room and their victims should all get to spend a few minutes with them in private.]]></description>
