<p>Matt Parvis of Pokernews.com asked : &#8220;Was there a discussion&#8230;on your arrival to Dublin, at any point was the file or document that we discussed earlier, about cash on hand vs. player deposits&#8211; was there a discussion about &#8216;hey we need to have a look at where this stands, right now&#8217;&#8230; and Lederer replies:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Clearly I felt like that was a question that was going to be number one on my list, <strong>my</strong> list of questions, when I got to Dublin. And my plans were to get there Sunday night and be in the office on Monday. There were a lot of other things that just had to be dealt with, there were just very short term, you know, block the U.S. players, figure out what we are doing about the url, which has been seized by the DOJ and is creating, it is actually making it impossible for us to allow our international customers to deposit, and&#8211; there were fires that had to be put out. Things like that, so that&#8217;s sucking a lot of air out of the room. The bandwidth, in terms of what you are thinking about. It&#8217;s just, I know it&#8217;s easy now to look back and go well, strategically, are you thinking about removing Ray, no, we are thinking about there is an FBI sticker when one of our international customers is clicking on the deposit button. That has to get fixed, <strong>right now</strong>. Right, that&#8217;s going to dominate your thinking. There was not a lot of strategic thinking done yet. But I knew I had to get to Dublin, and I knew I had to answer that question, &#8216;What&#8217;s the financial state of the company?'&#8221;    <span id="more-3249"></span></p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s not at all clear, as Howard says, that this was to be number one on his list, because it did not happen that way.  To say that there was no strategic thinking right then is exactly contrary to what was happening. He admits that the first thing to happen was to find a way to put out the &#8220;fire&#8221; by making sure that the international customers could deposit.  He did not say that those customers should be able to play, just to <em><strong>deposit</strong></em>.  Perhaps that is what was &#8220;clearly&#8221; number one on his list, by his own admission.</p>
<p>Lederer continues:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I was in the office by Monday morning sometime. Chris arrived midday-ish, maybe early afternoon, on the 18th. [Monday].So the two of us were there. We talked, we were aware of the backlog, we were aware of how that complicated answering the questions that we wanted to have answered. And we just sort of developed our own strategy, okay&#8211; &#8216;here are the questions we need to answer and get answered and before we can answer the simple question of what&#8217;s the financial state of the company'&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<p>Parvis then asked, &#8220;what was ultimately the answer that you found, the financial state of the company once you went through this process? And what date, if you recall&#8221;.</p>
<p>Lederer, very quickly and with no hesitation, answers:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Yeah, <strong><em>it was definitely the 21st of April</em></strong>. We&#8211; I mean I wasn&#8217;t thrilled on the on the 20th, I&#8217;m starting to get some information, just haven&#8217;t put it all together yet, I&#8217;m worried on the 20th. It doesn&#8217;t look good on the 20th, but the 21st is the day that the final report, we were able to put it all together and kind of just put a number, and again, it&#8217;s not an exact number, but it&#8217;s a horrific number, it doesn&#8217;t matter if it&#8217;s exact, and probably that number in terms of the difference between what was owed to the players and cash on hand was about $ 250 million, I believe, at that time&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<p>Parvis, &#8220;when you first see that number, are your thinking, okay clearly this is a mistake, or are you fairly confident now that through this process&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Lederer interrupts by saying &#8220;We were really thorough, we had to&#8211; <strong>no, I never thought it was a mistake&#8221;.</strong></p>
<p>He goes on to explain that he and Chris were surprised only by the fact that only $ 10 million of the backlog money was still sitting in the players accounts that could be deducted to further reduce the backlog effect.  <em>&#8220;I must admit I was floored by that number</em>&#8220;.</p>
<p>Therefore, by Lederer&#8217;s own admission, <em>the shortfall report, including the backlog, was not surprising,</em> only the fact that they could not reduce their liability based on those numbers, by more than $ 10 million.</p>
<p>When asked who, on April 21st, &#8216;was aware of the dire circumstance&#8217; that you were in? Who knows about the shortfall?</p>
<p>Lederer replies, <em>&#8220;at that moment?&#8230;the C.F.O., the C.E.O, Chris and me. When we found out, that&#8217;s who found out&#8221;.</em> When then asked how it was discussed to communicate this with other shareholders, Lederer goes on to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The second we found out, <strong>there is absolutely no thought of trying to hide it.</strong> It&#8217;s about trying to fix it. Trying to come up solutions on trying to fix it. So we immediately called a Board meeting, and we also invited all of the various company counsels, in particular, Barry Boss, Jeff Ifrah, and Ian Imrich onto that call; We had Rafe [Furst] on that call, and we also decided that our former chief of marketing, Bob Wolfe, should be on that call. He&#8217;s a seasoned, cool headed, executive and his experience was going to be really important and helpful to the company.  And we just shared the numbers with everyone on that call&#8221;. <em><sup class='footnote'><a href='#fn-3249-1' id='fnref-3249-1' onclick='return fdfootnote_show(3249)'>1</a></sup></em></p></blockquote>
<p>This is one of the few times in many hours of the taped interview that Lederer can be heard letting out a huge sigh.</p>
<p>The date of April 21, is significant in many ways, not the least of which is the domain <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/1jR9PpQAIfFqzplGcnYF1uRE-Lw0cKNnDzmfL3Ie5oI5P2NAHlHcdh0HALfi4/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://docs.google.com/file/d/1jR9PpQAIfFqzplGcnYF1uRE-Lw0cKNnDzmfL3Ie5oI5P2NAHlHcdh0HALfi4/', 'agreement']);" title="FTP executed domain name agreement"  target="_blank">agreement</a> being reached with the U.S. Attorneys Office  just a day or two earlier. According to this agreement, the D.O.J. <em>&#8220;expressly allows for FTP to provide for and facilitate players outside the U.S. to engage in playing online poker for real money through the domain, or any other domain names, sub-domain names, websites, or internet based means of communication, under the control of FTP&#8221;.</em> A reasonable person could assume that the U.S.A.O., before granting such permission, would have taken steps to have some assurance that rest of world play would be operating properly, fully funded and in compliance with their licensing regulations. Because SDNY clearly had been aware of possible monetary issues prior to Black Friday, (they had undercover players utilizing the site and also were aware of various poker forum postings in which deposit and withdrawal issues have been memorialized, not only for U.S. customers, but also international ones), they would have likely reached out to Full Tilt prior to executing the agreement for that assurance, as not doing so could have made the D.O.J. complicit in perpetrating the fraud against the players that they later charged against individuals at the company.</p>
<p>The other question that has sent shivers through the poker community since the status of FTP&#8217;s financial position became known, was the company&#8217;s continuation of using the term &#8220;safe and secure&#8221;, or similar language,  when referring to customers&#8217; funds in messages to the community after Black Friday.  During Lederer&#8217;s interview with the Two Plus Two Pokercast, he was asked to comment and answered:</p>
<blockquote><p> &#8220;I do not believe that <strong>safe and secure</strong>, that those words were used after April 20. And if it did happen, it happened without me knowing about it. There was a roomful of lawyers, there was a lot of people involved in that messaging, <strong>it was all being signed off</strong>,  and there was complete transparency with the lawyers, who were approving the language, after April 20th&#8221;. &#8230;I didn&#8217;t write the messaging, I was one of many people in that room&#8230;&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The pokercast team then asked further:  But there was no money?</p>
<p>To which Lederer replied, <em>&#8220;No that&#8217;s not true, there was money, the company was operating. &#8230;.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>There are numerous instances of the language used in messages to customers being, at best, inaccurate and misleading. An <a href="http://pokerfuse.com/features/editorial-opinion/please-know-your-funds-are-safe-and-secure-29-09/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://pokerfuse.com/features/editorial-opinion/please-know-your-funds-are-safe-and-secure-29-09/', 'article at Pokerfuse ']);" title="Safe and Secure language by FTP"  target="_blank">article at Pokerfuse </a>cites some perfect examples.</p>
<p>I reached out to Full Tilt attorney <a href="http://www.cozen.com/attorney_detail.asp?atid=721" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.cozen.com/attorney_detail.asp?atid=721', 'Barry Boss']);" title="Barry Boss Esq."  target="_blank">Barry Boss</a> for confirmation on both of these issues. Boss was the actual attorney that executed the domain agreement with the DOJ on behalf of Full Tilt.  He offered only the following comment for the record:  <em>“Any conversations that I had with my clients are privileged and I’m not at liberty to disclose them.”</em></p>
<p>When referring to any assurances given for the domain agreement or signing off on using the terminology &#8220;safe and secure&#8221; or similar, it&#8217;s well known that criminal defense attorneys are not in the business of setting policy for companys. Although Lederer did not  say that he was the one giving those assurances to his attorneys (keeping in mind his contention that there were other people in the room) before allowing them to sign that agreement (a question that was never asked), perhaps other questions might be in order.</p>
<p>Lederer contends that he found out about the financial state of the company only on April 21, 2011. Even if that were true, and I have reason to believe it is not, on April 22 did he take steps to change those statements and that assurance? On April 23? On April 24? May 1? May 15? June 1? June 15? June 28?  What steps did he take to stop or even to later rectify the false statements given out to the community on the poker forums by FTP Doug? The statement shown in the screenshot on the Full Tilt Poker website mainpage, the one right under the FBI and DOJ emblems,  advises customers that their funds are <strong><em>safe and secure. </em></strong></p>
<div id="attachment_3263" style="width: 450px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://diamondflushpoker.com/2012/10/the-distortion-of-truth-in-the-lederer-files-part-v/safe-and-secure-logo/" rel="attachment wp-att-3263"><img class="size-full wp-image-3263" title="safe and secure logo" src="http://diamondflushpoker.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/safe-and-secure-logo.bmp" alt="" width="440" height="256" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Source: Pokerfuse article Sept.29,2012</p></div>
<p><em>That statement appeared on the website until the company&#8217;s license was suspended on June 29, 2011 and could only have been posted when the site came back online <strong>after</strong> the domain agreement was executed. </em></p>
<p>Lederer was further questioned by Parvis, &#8220;the company continues to operate outside the U.S., continuing to collect deposits from rest of world players, full well knowing that they don&#8217;t have the funds on hand, a massive shortfall at this point.<em> Did you feel that it was the right thing to do, to continue to operate at that point?</em> &#8221;</p>
<p>Lederer answers:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Okay, so well, first I think we&#8217;ve skipped ahead a little bit, we&#8217;ve just gotten the news, we had that board meeting, and that what I can tell you is that  both Bob and Rafe immediately got on a plane, I think Ian did as well, and everyone convened in Dublin.  It was all about&#8211; you are still trying to wrap your head around the situation, it&#8217;s overwhelming, but it&#8217;s all about trying to find a solution, and knowing that the only way that we are going to solve this problem is to preserve the assets of the company, the very valuable assets of the company, and use those assets to effect some sort of a transaction that&#8217;s going to inject enough cash into the company or sell the company outright to make sure that our customers get paid. That we knew, how that&#8217;s going to happen, we&#8217;re just starting to try to wrap our head around the problem. I just think that day, it&#8217;s not, again, much like the news on the 15th, and in fact the news on the 21st was much more of a shock to me than the news on the 15th. The news on the 15th was terrible, but it&#8217;s like, okay here is something, the company is going to have to deal with this and work through it and it&#8217;s a solvable problem. See PokerStars for example. The idea that there was even a chance that our customers might not get their money was just&#8211; , it hadn&#8217;t&#8211; , that thought had really never really been a part of my mind space, ever, it was just such a shock to me that that might happen. It was good to have that call, it was good that some  concerned citizens were on their way to Dublin that were going to try to work through these issues.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Having completely avoided the question about the fairness of continuing to operate in the rest of the world, Lederer was able to shift the answer to be totally no longer about him, but about the &#8220;team&#8221; that he put together to help &#8220;solve the problem&#8221;.</p>
<p>The question was not asked again.</p>
<p>The questions shifted to when the &#8220;dire circumstances&#8221; were communicated to other shareholders.</p>
<p>Lederer leads in appearing to not recall the date of the first members call. Instead he claims that he wanted to have some answers first.   According to Howard:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8221; it would not be constructive to have a member call on the 21st or the 22nd, and literally the call is just like screaming, &#8230;not angry screaming, but &#8216;We&#8217;re panicing&#8217;. Just chaos. That&#8217;s not going to be constructive. We had to, after a night&#8217;s sleep, this is pretty big news, you have to digest it, you need to come into the office and you need to have some experienced people, and you need to consult with attorneys, and you need to gather some information so that you can provide information and options, and choices, to the membership, as opposed to just dire news&#8230; So I believe our first call was&#8211; days later, not the 22nd or 23rd, the 25th at the earliest, maybe even the 27th, I am not sure.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>He does admit though, to speaking to a number of the members privately, but asking them to keep it in confidence. He also claims not to know who it was that communicated the news to the group on the first real member call, although he does admit to doing a lot of the talking on the member calls. &#8220;Those early calls were difficult, and they weren&#8217;t as productive as I would have liked them to be&#8221;.</p>
<p>The first full member call would not take place until May 1, 2011, more than two weeks after Black Friday.</p>
<p>When remembering roll call on that first member call, Howard felt it was necessary to point out that Perry Friedman, one minority shareholder, had his attorney speak for him on the call, citing the notice for the call as the reason for Friedman sitting out. He claims to have been<em> concerned about the chilling effect that &#8216;members like that&#8221; would have on the group as a functioning entity, and that he knew that it was very important for the group to function as an entity&#8211; if we were going to solve our problems.</em> Howard then says:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;by the time the second call rolls around, that there were probably nine or ten individual attorneys representing members on that call.  If anyone has tried to have a constructive conversation with twenty-three people and ten of their personal attorneys under conditions like this, you can imagine it was just impossible&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>When asked who was leading the charge in terms of coming up with a coherant plan to move forward and essentially get this problem resolved, Howard replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The membership was a problem. We were our own worst enemy. I think that all of the owners that hadn&#8217;t been active in management and hadn&#8217;t been active in creating the shortfall, of which there are twenty-two&#8211;, it&#8217;s very easy to feel like a victim in a situation like this. There are owners that were getting checks, they thought that the company was in great shape and now all of a sudden they are being told that there is $ 250 million missing. There was a lot of anger, and I just think that in situations like that its very difficult to get people to take responsibility for the problem&#8230; No matter who was actually actively culpable for creating the problem, we own the company, we were responsible, and there were a number of owners, I felt like, that understood that&#8230;and we had another group of owners that were much more interested in trying to figure out who was at fault&#8230;The problem with that way of thinking is that if we figure out who was at fault, how does that get anybody paid, it doesn&#8217;t solve the problem. The only thing that mattered was getting our customers paid. That was our moral responsibility to the poker community, and it was very hard to get the whole group of twenty-three to move forward in that direction&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<p>Parvis asked Lederer whether there were people that seemed unconcerned that players got paid as a first priority, and Lederer said he felt <em>&#8220;some owners did not have that as a first priority, that&#8217;s what it felt like to me. I believe a lot of owners felt it was very important that whatever deal we strike is a really profitable one for us, for the owners&#8221;.</em></p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Howard has lost alot of weight. He used to be really fat. </p>
<p>I wish that the gypsy women in the stephen King movie Thinner would come along and make a pie that would make Howard gain all of his weight back plus 400 pounds. Actually that he would just keep gaining weight until the literally exploded. </p>
<p>Its amazing how easy it is for these scum of the earth to steal everyones money , live the high life, keep everything they stole and do a few stupid interviews where no hard questions where asked, and then show up in the poker community again, playing as if nothing happened. </p>
<p>a few years back I was in a florida casino playing 2/5 NL when I heard a commotion at a table. Turns out Russ Hamilton showed up to play some 10/20NL and the guys at the table basically told him to ffff off and called him every name in the book and Fat ass Russ had to leave. As he was leaving he dropped his chip rack and the guys needling him started grabbing his chips and saying, dont worry we will give these back to the people you ripped off. That action got the 2 guys kicked out of the casino and Russ actually had the nerve to sit down and play after all that. </p>
<p>Its just amazing to me the nerve of these vial idiots. they should be put in a room and their victims should all get to spend a few minutes with them in private.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Thank you DF for the work you are doing here to help bring to light the shadowy half truths and omisions from the Lederer interviews.
