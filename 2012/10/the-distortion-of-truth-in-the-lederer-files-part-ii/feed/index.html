		<description><![CDATA[A big concern for me surrounds the customer email.  Howard admits his focus is on providing &#039;the customer with a good answer&#039;.  Anyone with a shred of credibility/acumen would actually turn the focus inward, and ensure the company had protocols in place (beyond producing reports) to segregate player funds.  Once you had such things nailed down, not only would the customer get &#039;a good answer&#039;, but you could make an unequivocal statement to your entire customer base about the security of their money.

Further, you&#039;d satisfy yourself that the funds being withdrawn were indeed &#039;excess cash&#039; above and beyond player liabilities, and funds earmarked for operations.

Bottom line - &#039;a good answer&#039; = something to cover our ass while placating the customer concern, without actually fixing anything.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Diamond, 

I enjoyed the first part a lot, but this second part does not bring too much new information.. Mostly quoting what was said (and I watched all the PN vids + 2p2 podcasts)... Also all the quoting and references create a little confusion in the article, hope the next parts will bring more clarity. 

This is partly due to the fact that articles with plain text and many referencing probably don´t tell the big picture story in the best understandable way. Better format might be a video-presentation of the matrix of facts and holes in HL argumentation and how they match together? 

But anyways, thanks a lot for the great work, I appreciate it in any form.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What&#039;s the big issue with segregated accounts.  We will take profits and distributions to share holders.  There is no way everybody asks for the money back at one time.   It&#039;s a easy concept a gambler should understand.   Has HL not given lectures on bankroll?  He is the professor with a Ivey League education.  Did his lawyers respond first?  Obviously there accounts were segregated.]]></description>
