		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for all that inside knowledge, but why aren&#039;t you telling the story till the end?
Between the first installments were only a few days, now we&#039;re waiting almost two weeks...Is it legal issues that are keeping you from laying down how exactly Mr. Lederer distorted the truth?
Otherwise it would seem a bad decission to let us wait just to let the excitment rise...
Keep it up, but do it regulary!

		<description><![CDATA[Your reporting is excellent and I have learned a lot, especially from part IV.  However, what does PI&#039;s looking for more money from FTP in 2009 have to do with either the Lederer Files or the demise of FTP?  Reads to me like a leak from someone in the anti-Ivey camp and I think it does not fit in this series.]]></description>
