		<description><![CDATA[it is obvious Hl and friends took the money and ran. He better take that money and hide. I am shocked no one has at least kicked his ass by now. I don&#039;t advocate violence but if it happened I wouldn&#039;t feel sorry for him at all. 

As for the US every allowing online gaming, we are losing more and more freedoms every day. Unless a politician can figure out a way to line his own pockets by legalizing it, it probably wont happen.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was disappointed with Lederer&#039;s interview, given the impact that this scandal has had on the poker community and the victims affected. I felt the recording was not heart-felt, given that it appeared to be choreographed expertly. Lederer should have come out and taken more responsibility for his actions and the actions of his company as opposed to deflecting blame from himself. In my opinion, he was very lucky to avoid prosecution.]]></description>
