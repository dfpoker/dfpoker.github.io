		<description><![CDATA[its all because Ivey is smart and can see 3 months into the future. Which is why he final tables like 5 events every year at the wsop and some people play for a decade and never see a final table. 

So he saw the downfall of FT and got that in his divorce knowing damn well that he wouldnt have pay that biatch any money after FT came toppling over. 

Well done Ivey, well done. I wish I had a clause like that in my divorce. damn.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I believe everything howard is saying. Just because he is a dufus and a bag of hammers has more intelligence then him doesnt mean he set out to do this on purpose or was greedy in anyway. 

its funny how people can sit back and say he should have given all this money back, etc. Would you do that? facing the fact that you probably wont have an income for the next couple of years, and you have massive expenses, and cost of living, I would love to see what any of you would do if in that situation. You would hide your money under your bed and you wouldnt be giving up a red cent. 

The only reason why Jesus did is because he made so much more for one, and he also wasnt nearly as much of a big spender as HL. 

HL will be back at the WSOP next year, and I am sure he will be in business again in the poker community within a few years. 

I have spoken with him personally a few times since he went into lockdown and this has been planned out. its all going according to plan and everyone is falling right into it. Doyle Brunson was the one that told him to come to their games, and he supports him, so there you go. 

Your all wasting your time debating this. Its over. Bitar is busted and has taken the fall and HL, Jesus, Ivey, and everyone else that ran off with millions is laughing as they check their online bank and stock balances. Its life. getover it.

		<description><![CDATA[DF, regarding the $17.75 million in additional payments to other owners via the secret CF/PK account $7m goes out right before black Friday. By my math that is $5m to Player 1 and $2m to EL.  What about the other $10.75m?

 Any idea whether these were loans or payments of some type?  If they were loans, then a lot of people must owe a lot of money to CF personally?  Must be nice for him.  A rainy day fund held by friends to keep it out of the prying hands of the DOJ?  If they were payments then what could they possibly be for?  I assume you know who the others are that got money from this account.  If you can&#039;t say who they were, can you rule out that no board members got off-the-book loans/payments?

It was a Pocket Kings account? It was technically a PK asset?  That means they were mixing operational expenses with shareholder assets?  It was a slush fund of sorts CF provided to help with emergencies and to buy shares back and so fourth?  That might be generous of CF to help PK in this way, but these payments certainly would smell very bad to both the IRS and Irish tax authorities.  Was this account audited by GT?

This reporting is so excellent.  Keep it up.  I am shocked that it is not making bigger waves.  Well, it got me typing...

		<description><![CDATA[its clear that these interviews have worked in his favor, wheather the content is a bunch of BS or not. I think its all a bunch of BS, but its a clear well laid plan to get him into the poker community again. He is already out playing again in the high stakes rooms and 100% forsure he will be playing at WSOP next year if he isnt arrested and in jail. 

Its so sick. He also never inteneded to have your interview, which is the reason why yours was schedueld last. Such a joke. 

If I ever run into him in a poker room, I will needle him and take shots at him as long as I can get away with it. He ruined my life practically. I had my whole bankroll tied up on that site, and I literally on the 10th had made a significant WD after spending a year building and building. I was ready to hit the world series for the first time armed with a big enough roll to play all of the tournies i wanted, the main event, and some good side games and imagine my disappointment. After BF I had to literally start over with 300.00 and to this day, I have not been able to build my BR to the size I had it. 

I often wonder where I would be right now, if that asshole hadnt been so greedy. Building multi million dollar homes, and spending enough money to feed a 3rd world country. 

as HL would say.......and I quote......Look, I just dont know. I needed like over a million a month just for casual spending...and look, I just cant remember where all the money went. I mean, look, I spent it ok. thats all I want to speculate on that...

		<description><![CDATA[Regarding HL and actions:

-Howard knows he is on the way out and suddenly decides the company needs a policy on cash coverage.  Was he thinking about players or fortifying the Ray as fall-guy firewall?  
-Imrich managed to get money beyond the 12 million  in fees from the CF account and the DOJ did not know about (but you did,) and we know there were loans made to other members from this account. We also know that HL&#039;s loan was actually a slush fund of sorts to move money off/on FTP.  It seems possible/probable that HL and CF are owed money from existing player balances stuck on the site.  Now that Stars is going to make these players whole, who gets that money?
-In the 2+2 interview it is pretty clear HL faced a real reckoning regarding letting RB&#039;s salary continue.  He felt he had no choice. He concedes that gambling with what was left of player money to try to get someone to pay off the players was his only option.  Is paying someone to go to jail for you legal?
-He used up the 60m or so that was left of the player money to keep the company going for a year, and he seems to admit in the 2+2 interview that this was against the advice of lawyers.  Is that legal?
-Paypal left the US market in 2004.  By the time HL stops day-to-day management the legal threats are very well known and very real.  Howard already has a record for a gambling related charge. He clearly knew the risks.   If  his &quot;baby&quot; was a grey-market company and he wanted to shift the legal risk to someone who agreed to take the fall is there any scenario in which he would have allowed that person to be removed?

		<description><![CDATA[Diamond, 

Have you explored how PI&#039;s divorce proceeding may tie in here.  Specifically we know that:

 &quot; According to the agreement, if Phil Ivey stops receiving funds from Tiltware, Luciaetta Ivey&#039;s alimony &quot;will cease.&quot;  (http://www.lvrj.com/news/ex-wife-of-poker-star-ivey-got-millions-in-divorce-settlement-135846023.html)

We know at this time:

-PI is trying to get out of the Tiltware &quot;golden handcuffs&quot; to generate income, presumably from another deal (but does not want to give up the shares.)
-He wants a big loan
-Whatever his motivation with the lawsuit it does not seem that FTP solvency was his primary goal

I am sure you are already on this, but have not heard it discussed.]]></description>
