		<description><![CDATA[I can&#039;t see Elie and Campos being granted permission for this. Especially as poker &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a game subject to chance. I suppose it could be argued that it&#039;s not subject to chance long term, but the law doesn&#039;t specify any time period. 

It would just be a huge detour that would confuse the jury, which is probably the intent anyway. I hope it is granted though. I don&#039;t want to see the U.S.&#039;s corrupt, protectionist,  lobbying/bribing/piggyback law passing system winning this. 

Kudos to you, DF, for writing such a detailed report. Yes, I read it all :-) Keep up the excellent work. It is greatly appreciated.]]></description>
