There is still a chance that ELG will make good on your funds, but in case they don&#039;t, everyone will continue to look into this, I am sure.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I thought it was important to get the limited info out right away, rather than hit it from the legal side of things only, which takes me a little longer, since IANAL. But, if I run into someone named Vanessa, I will be sure to send her your regards ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for this.  I read the entire court documents.  So, how are we supposed to get our final payment now?  Would it be suggested to try and contact the agents involved in this and ask them if they can come to an agreement and make arrangements for the one-time, final payment of the accounts?

It saddens me that simple poker players and their money get caught in between this.  Poker is just a game, an honorable game, one that has a rich and traditional history in the US  and this business here was simply trying to honor their obligation to return our funds. Poker is not played against the website, but rather against other simple players. This money represents a collection of those players money and was being returned to them.]]></description>
