		<description><![CDATA[This statement shows that you have very little understanding of what &#039;material fact&#039; means. It&#039;s a standard term that does not imply a belief by the author in whether they are true or not just because the word &#039;fact&#039; is in it. You seriously think you can&#039;t talk about the &#039;facts&#039; of the case as presented by someone without implying that they are 100% accurate? Get give me a break.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great interview.  Thank for all of your effort to get to the bottom of everything that happened with Full Tilt and the various roles that payment processors played.  You have been very thorough in your research of the entire matter.  That said, I&#039;m surprised that you did not delve further into Chad&#039;s decision to end the legal fight and plead guilty.  That is probably one of the most important decisions that he made in this whole affair and it was glossed over in the interview.  Why was this subject not discussed in further detail?  Thanks again.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Eddie and others are quick to slag Chad,only wish they were read your interview first as clearly they have not.Chad is very open about his involvement.It is also clear that he did not conspire in any way to steal anything or anyones money.It is a matter of record that he took advice from more than one legal firm that advised him he was operating in a legal way.This now appears not to be so BUT his intent was not to work outside of the law. First class interview Diamond Flush. And as always thank you Chad for trying to lift the veil on the real crooks.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In your second to last paragraph you write &quot;It has some, but little, editing, and no material facts were deleted.&quot;  Shouldn&#039;t you term this as &quot;material information&quot; rather than &quot;material facts&quot;?  Are you deciding the information in the interview is a &quot;fact&quot;?  This statement shows you have a bias that what you report is fact and that interviewing a subject by yourself determines that what has been said is a fact.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There is a very big difference between one person saying things to &quot;look like a good guy&quot; when it&#039;s to distance oneself from any responsibility of, at the very least, a missing $ 330+ million and to stay out of jail, and another person telling their story, who didn&#039;t have any relationship to missing player funds and is going to federal prison for processing online poker.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[DF is telling us most of what Howard said is to make him sound like the good guy yet that same thing doesn&#039;t stand true for Chad&#039;s story? Can someone please tell me how you decide which criminal&#039;s words you take to be the truth?]]></description>
