		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m sorry you feel that way. Unless the comment is full of four letter words or advertisements, I usually approve it, whether its flattering or not. I have an automatic spam filter installed that should be taking care of that. I don&#039;t remember modding out any of your posts. In addition, since the claims in the articles are not about me, my identity should have no bearing on whether you want to confirm or deny them. The facts are what they are. If you disagree with something specific that a source has told me, and you believe that Lederer&#039;s specific comments that I referred to were true, you are welcome to post it here.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[DF, care to explain why my comments on part V were never moderated or approved? Or would you like me to do that for you? My comments were never approved because I have a dissenting opinion to yours and apparently that is good for whatever personal goals you have for doing these &quot;articles&quot;. You are an anonymous person citing anonymous sources. How can any logical person not question the factuality of what you report? I actually think much of what you say has value but as a thinking person I cannot simply accept what you say as truth simply because you say it is true. NO ONE KNOWS WHO YOU ARE AND CAN CONFIRM OR REFUTE WHAT YOU SAY BECUASE OF THAT. But I have seen what you do with dissenting views. You bury them by not &quot;moderating&quot; them. Way to stay objective.]]></description>
