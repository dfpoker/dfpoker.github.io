		<description><![CDATA[I am one of the players who maintained (or, resumed) loyally to Full Tilt Poker.  In my case, the loyalty is exclusive to Full Tilt.
I can&#039;t speak for other players, but in my own case, the renewed loyalty was a result of;
- investigating the events which led to the demise to start with, and realizing the placement of guilt was 100% disconnected from the software 
- researching and understanding the competence level of PokerStars business management / history
- continuing the well-researched opinion that the games, structures and competition at FTP are second-to-none in the industry

As for why PokerStars themselves made the decision to keep the name - I don&#039;t know.  It&#039;s possible their reasons are similar, but it would have been quite the gamble using the same perspective, as they&#039;d have to assume everyone acted as I have throughout the whole mess.  
Thus far, I&#039;d say the FTP rebuild is at about 35-45% of what it was pre-BF (not including U.S. player involvement).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m still trying to work out why so many people are so excited about the re-launch of the Full Tilt brand.  I understand why Pokerstars chose to buy Full Tilt ... they had a huge client base, which will become loyal to Pokerstars through repayment, and the software they used was, reportedly, some of the best in the business.

But software can be re-branded and re-skinned, and users can be re-directed to other places for actual play.  I can&#039;t work out what makes the Full Tilt brand SO valuable that people are willing to ignore the taint that is attached to the name.  I understand why Pokerstars bought Full Tilt ... I can&#039;t figure out why they are keeping the brand however, instead of re-skinning the software and re-directing the users.]]></description>
