		<description><![CDATA[Just finished reading, very interesting. Here is what I am torn over... The missing money, was it just forfeitures, seizures, thefts, and bad investments that led them to have less money than needed to cover player liability? Or we&#039;re HL, RB and possibly the other board member stealing money, and if so, where did that money go? Seems to me like there are 2 different levels of scumbag, and idk which HL should be labeled. Did they make a bad mistake approving deposits that they would never be able to receive and that, coupled with thefts, seizures and apparently investing in other companies (the article touched on the fact that RB was named the head of several business associated with FTP, but never goes into what those businesses were. Were they legit investments that didn&#039;t pan out? Were they just a way to funnel money?)  cause them to be that far under in terms of cash on hand? Or did HL, RB and the other board members steal money from the site knowingly out of greed? To live the $200,000 a month lobster habit DN refers to in his rant? Seems like the former is somewhat forgivable in that a bad decision (crediting accounts before the deposit goes through) coupled with the US government shutting down the site before potential new payment processors could start to cut into the backlog, is more of mistake and the latter ought to have (at least) HL and RB shunned from the community. And if HL were just a good man that mad a big mistake, why didn&#039;t he offer up any of his money for transition 2.0? I remember reading he received more than $40 million over the years with FTP. In the end, I am left feeling like HL got off easily in this case, and my opinion of him has changed 180 degrees since watching him on tv in the early 2000s. But I am left with some reservations, what happened to all the embezzled money and why knowingly steal if you are getting paid $1 million a month? Please, if you can, she&#039;d some light as I am not the brightest bulb in the shed. Thanks.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It appears FT&#039;s CEO and CFO did basically what Enron did.  They hid the true state of the companies finances from the owners and the board with fake financial reports.  Enron was one of the largest scandals ever back in 2001.  Enron&#039;s outside auditing company Arthur Anderson also went bankrupt as a result.  If a huge auditing company like Arthur Anderson couldn&#039;t uncover the true financial picture of Enron it wouldn&#039;t  shock me that the guys running FT couldn&#039;t pull a fast one on the poker players that owned FT and made up the board.  I&#039;m sure as long as the guys actually running FT (Bitar, and the financial weenies) paid out distributions the owners probably trusted the fake financial reports they were shown.  

The law passed after Enron went bankrupt, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to be specific required outside auditing for public companies.   FT wasn&#039;t a public company and possibly not audited by anybody that couldn&#039;t be bribed to keep the truth from getting out.  You would like to think that if Ray Bitar let the owners know the true state of the companies finances they would have accepted smaller distributions.   Problem is they had so many poker playing owners that it wouldn&#039;t take long for one or to to tell a friend.  Rumors spread fast in the poker community and the customers would find out.  Nobody would deposit if they knew FT didn&#039;t have the money to pay out existing accounts, so Bitar chose to hide the truth as long as he could probably hoping that future profits would bring the company back to financial health.  

 You did an excellent job reporting on this Diamond.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Diamond,

This article was a great way to finish the series. Really appreciate all the time and effort you&#039;ve put into your investigations. 

One quick question. I know you published an interview with Andy Bloch and I believe at the time you mentioned there would be other FTP pros following suit. Do you still have plans to interview other FTP pros and if so can you say who and when we might see them published?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ll give it a shot...

I can&#039;t plan in advance what I might write, but one would expect there will be more information out in the future. Lederer still has a civil fraud and forfeiture suit against him pending, as does Ferguson, and Bitar&#039;s cases are also open.

I don&#039;t gain anything really, in fact it costs me monthly much more than I can afford, especially now with more travel and meetings.  I feel as if I have an obligation to see it through, to find as many answers as is possible, so I will continue to work on that as long as I can.

For various reasons I won&#039;t share my worksheets about the excess missing funds at this time.  That could change in the future.

I have tried to give as much information as time and space allow for the questions presented.  I hope it&#039;s not that difficult to determine what Lederer&#039;s answers should have been/should be for most of them, but until they are asked of him and answered, I probably will not comment on them further. At least not right now. Others that are aware of many of those same answers apparently feel the same way.

Best I can do for now, thanks for reading.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[An absolutely fascinating conclusion to an extremely well researched, well written and incisive series of articles.
A couple of questions to you if you would care to answer: no offense taken at all if you don&#039;t as they may may not seem related wholly to your articles:
Now that you have written the conclusion do you expect to write any follow-up articles in the future regarding Lederer? 
What, if anything, did you gain from the enormous amount of work you have put into this?
When you say that in your view the numbers didn&#039;t add up, is there any chance that you could make public your worksheets that led you to this conclusion?  
When you say at the end of this conclusion that, &quot; The answers to many of the above questions, and those raised in the previous installments, are already known to this author and others&quot;, may I ask why if they are known you have not said as much?]]></description>
