		<description><![CDATA[I think the definition of fugitive is a little murky to the layperson, but if you mean Isai Scheinberg, he did not flee the jurisdiction and afaik, his whereabouts are known, so I don&#039;t know the answer. He also was not CEO, but was required to step down in any managerial or directors role as part of the settlement (this can be revisited at a later time). I do not know where you got your information that he owns 90% of PS, no such information has ever been proffered that I know of.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Isn&#039;t the owner of pokerstars still a fugitive from the US?  I know he had to step down as CEO but doesn&#039;t he still own ~90% of pokerstars?   How can NJ approve him as an owner of a casino given he is a fugitive from justice?]]></description>
