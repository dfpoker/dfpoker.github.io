		<description><![CDATA[Seems low-life runs in his family. Do you think he prays before he starts his million dollar car each day? Probably not, he&#039;d have to believe in God first. I&#039;m sure when he has to answer to Him, &quot;I don&#039;t know&quot; won&#039;t go over too well and then it&#039;s straight to Hell. &quot;I&#039;m all in Satan&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The funds were missing from FTP long before Black Friday. BF caused only another very small amount in comparison to be frozen. They had plenty of time prior to BF to raise the funds or sell the company as you suggest. They did neither, and in fact continued the ruse that everything was hunky dory until too much information got out.

They (FTP) did not eventually sell the company.  They forfeited the company to the US govt to have the civil in rem charges against the company dropped.  If they hadnt done that, liquidation was the only other resort and they owed too much money out for that to be a feasible answer to the problem.  PokerStars bought only some of FTP&#039;s assets from the US government as part of their settlement.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As much as I cant stand Howard Lederer,why shouldn&#039;t he(as an owner of FTP) be entitled to keep millions in profit?  Should he have to forfeit all his earnings from FTP?  I think not.  The DOJ went after him civilly because he hasnt committed any criminal offenses.  The DOJ sued him civilly because they know they can easily squeeze money out of him.  His gains from FTP were not ill gotten, he helped run a thriving business and as a result was rewarded handsomly. Had the US govt not interfered(black fridy), i believe FTP would have raised the capital to pay players back and if they werent able too would then have sold the company in order to pay back its liabilities(player funds).  This in fact has happened (FTP was sold) and all player funds will eventually be repaid.  I do understand that a small percentage of players have large sums stuck on the site but at this point it is the US govt that is holding your funds hostage, not Howard or any other owner of FTP. For the record i only have approx 5k locked up on FTP.]]></description>
