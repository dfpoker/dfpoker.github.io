		<description><![CDATA[Fact: In this article I made clear that there were multiple scenarios under which players could receive compensation via playthrough/deposits etc.
Fact: in his defense, he did not say players with large balances would have been repaid in 18 months, in fact, big balances could have been tied up to 5 years. If you read the article, again, this is clearly spelled out.  
Fiction: You are an objective reader with no agenda.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Fact: You didn&#039;t outline how quickly players (the rate of which) wouldve been able to clear their balances for withdrawal. 

Fact: Tapie writes that players with big balances wouldve been repayed by 18 months. How do you (how does he?) reconcile this if players have to play to allow their balances to be withdrawn?

Fiction: We can objectively evaluate this plan]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[LOL at &quot;sabotage&quot;.  So GBT tried to get FTP for 20 mil down and promises of more to various parties if could turn a profit.  Don&#039;t blame them for trying; they didn&#039;t fail due to being cheap.  They failed by not understanding the DOJ&#039;s priorities.  DOJ needs cooperation of foreign governments in this and other affairs.  They don&#039;t need some yahoo coming in with a deal that leaves ROW players with high risk of not being repaid, and with thousands complaining about the process even if it works out.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am pretty sure that points and tourney tickets would have been credited as they had been when the site went down, i.e. in the same form, not cash, for ROW players.  I do not know how the DOJ would have handled those via the remission process. Tbh, I do not remember about the medals, I would have to check my notes.]]></description>
