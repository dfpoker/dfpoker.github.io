		<description><![CDATA[Neat piece.  Slightly disagree with one point, hvewoer.IF it is determined that poker does not fit the definition of  gambling (because of the skill element involved) then it seems the Govt&#039;s case basically falls apart   even the money laundering.  After all, you kind of need some kind of illegal activity on the other end; otherwise, spurious financial arrangements are just that   and out of the reach of DOJ.Seems to hinge on whether poker fits the definition of gambling.I like to compare poker to roulette.  When you put money on the roulette table, there is virtually zero skill involved in the outcome.  It is 100% chance.By contrast, you don&#039;t even have to put up money to see your cards in poker (unless you&#039;re in the blinds   and if that&#039;s a problem, they could get rid of blinds).  Once you put money up to play a hand, the outcome of the hand is NOT determined entirely by chance.  Big difference.Marriage is a gamble.  I hate to think of the consequences if DOJ ever figures THAT out.]]></description>
