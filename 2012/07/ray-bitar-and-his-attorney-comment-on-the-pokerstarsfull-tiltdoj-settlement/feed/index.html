		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s about time this news was revealed, I only hope irreparable damage has not been made to poker as a whole, given the dark circumstances that have occurred over the last few years. It&#039;s great news that Full Tilt users will finally be reimbursed what is rightfully owed to them. I hope this case, and all the bitter litigation that has ensued, will serve as an example to any company bosses who wish to undertake such risky and illegal practices for the benefit of their own profits. Hopefully with this statement a line can be drawn under the whole episode and poker can move forward.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ray, Good luck in your legal battles.  Not to many people are going to say thank you to you, but I will.  Thank you for what you have done for the online poker community even thought you are now facing prison time.  Without you and the others that took the risk to get the sites up and running we would not be were we are today.  Just wish things could have turned out different for you on your end. 

Maybe with the sale of the site and Pokerstars paying off the players, we can get the law changed and get all of this behind us.   I didn&#039;t lose and money per say, only a few freeroll tickets.  Nevertheless, good luck and thank you for taking the risk to get things this far, not to many people would have done what you did to bring on line poker this far.]]></description>
