		<description><![CDATA[Agreed... although with a calmer head :-)

If the government&#039;s assertion that using security and cameras is proof that gambling is taking place, then I guess every legitimate business in the U.S. that employees security and uses cameras now qualifies as a casino.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Understood and agree sir. I suppose I was trying to say that the government being the Appellant in the case made it DiCristina&#039;s &quot;case to lose&quot; in a matter of speaking. IMO, the statutory interpretation is what is ambiguous as to the definition of &quot;gambling&quot;. If you consider section B(2) of the statute where the 9 games are enumerated, one aspect to consider (but not the only one) could be the skill v chance argument to separate poker from the mix. The government contends that section is moot and that any game in which there is a wager qualifies as gambling although the statute doesn&#039;t say exactly that.  Clearly Weinstein relied on the evidence presented in the trial as to skill v chance for his decision.  The government chose not to &quot;go there&quot; in the appeal arguments.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Excellent summary, appreciate the detailed review of the arguments.

One minor quibble. &quot;The burden was on the government to prove that the Weinstein decision should be overturned.&quot; Technically, appeals are not about &quot;burdens of proof&quot; such as are referenced in trial court. Appeals are about review of errors and the court is interested in &quot;standards of review&quot;. Here, issues of statutory interpretation are matters of law and the appellate court owes the Weinstein decision no deference. To the extent the court wades into factual issues, the appellate court will give Weinstein signficant deference.

So, if the appellate court decides that the IGBA covers any gambling under state law without additional analysis, that would be a legal determination and the court would not need to wade into the &quot;skill v. chance&quot; issue. On this issue, the parties theoretically start on equal footing with no advantage to DiCristina merely because the trial court ruled for him. If the appellate court reaches the &quot;skill v. chance&quot; issue, however, DiCristina does start with a significant (and probably insurmountable) advantage.]]></description>
