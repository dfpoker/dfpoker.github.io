I don&#039;t need for the man to die for what he did - but I wouldn&#039;t lose any sleep over it either.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wow interesting projected outcome. Surely the need for a heart transplant is a direct result of the self inflicted stress and anxiety he caused himself by stealing money from the poker community and using it to buy thousands of hot dogs. I wonder how much money lederer and ferguson have reserved for him pending a successful transplant. Hate to say it, but they probably secretly hope he doesn&#039;t make it, which wouldn&#039;t surprise me after everything that&#039;s transpired. It appears that the full tilt scheme has officially worked and the fall guy may not even fall. Gotta give the 3 credit they capitalized on us all, but who were we to think our money was safe, we knew this was an illegal operation from the beginning. Diamond flush, I couldn&#039;t help but notice you seem a bit worn out from this whole story as I am as well, perhaps due to the lack of justice in this case. However, thanks so much for your in depth coverage of this crazy debacle.  Looking forward to the players getting repaid.
