		<description><![CDATA[Sure seems like there are some very scared casinos operators in Atlantic City and they are doing everything they can to keep out some tough competition from PokerStars when online gaming begins.  Is this the same Mike Frailey who has been praising Stars for the last 6 months ?   Why is Atlantic Club now silent in responding?
I do believe they were trying to make another deal that would keep PokerStars out of AC.  Maybe the AGA is involved again in helping the Atlantic Club.  A lot of politics going on here.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Are you perhaps confusing PokerStars with Full Tilt Poker?  AFAIK, PokerStars never has been accused of stealing anything from US players, in fact they paid US players post Black Friday in record time.  It was Full Tilt Poker that kept players from more than $ 300million of their money when it came out that they didnt have the money. (FTP now is owned by PokerStars, but PokerStars had no interest in the &quot;original&quot; Full Tilt, in fact they were head to head competitors. PokerStars bailed out the customers of original Full Tilt when FTP was forced to give up their assets to the U.S. DOJ, PokerStars bought those assets and either paid &quot;rest of world&quot; customers directly for what FTP owed them or, for US customers, PokerStars paid the DOJ and the DOJ will be repaying US customers thru the remission process). Detailed information on all of this is available in articles here on this website.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Personally, I&#039;m hoping that Poker Stars gets screwed and lose millions, just like they stole from all the U.S. players.  NJ needs to insert a &quot;bad guy&quot; clause to their existing law just like NV did.  That would kick PS out of the game forever.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Maybe the Atlantic thinks they can get themselves out of their current hole by doing online poker on their own.  Maybe one of the big casino players in the AGA offered to partner with the the Atlantic in the online poker market.  Or maybe the same casino offered a large lump sum payment to the Atlantic if they would terminate the contract with Pokerstars.  Maybe some combination of all of the above.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yeah, seems all a bit dodgy. I don&#039;t fully understand why the Atlantic now would not want to extend the waiting period a little longer if Stars is paying the operating losses as well?]]></description>
