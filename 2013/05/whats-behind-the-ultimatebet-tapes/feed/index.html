		<description><![CDATA[This is the tip of the iceberg of what is still to come. I played there 2003-2006 and called UB openly out on their cheating scam(s) initially during their biggest weekly tournament held at the time one Sunday in August 2004, beginning with the pro host not actually playing that tourney and realizing clearing that day the cheating scams were also evident, yet unsure who was involved in it. They held a new and unique damage control tournament a few days later which began the WestTexasMan Owns tourneys with &#039;beanie&#039; tables.  Which pros didn&#039;t play was as interesting as those who did that evening as well as the table banter. Oh the drama between UB and me back then.  Annie, et al, are getting their just desserts and so be it.   Seeing hole cards as well as setting up winning hands was rampant (I have no clue how this was done but it was and to me personally). But hey, what did I REALLY know at the time. I was a naive newb right? Congrats on your persistent investigation and upcoming movie. There is so much more to uncover from those days and no doubt it will. I&#039;m still hopeful for congressional investigations about what endeavors some of that money funded...ultimately lol. Good luck.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt;&gt; Some things weren’t clear in this article and the overall narrative was frankly quite confusing.

The article is written as context for the current information and assumes the reader is conversant with the past five years and basic facts of the case. Full understanding requires a longer treatment like a documentary. We are working to provide that.

&gt;&gt; So what’s the reason for T. Makar releasing all the docs/audio now (and supposedly now in their entirety and ones that are most damaging)? You seem to imply attempt at extortion before, so does this mean T.Makar has giving up on making money off this stuff? He’s now releasing all this stuff for free.

The value of the information is significantly lower today than any time in the past. Criminal statutes of limitations recently passed, a Civil RICO Class Action on behalf of players would require a judge to toll the case. The primary value left in the information is to embarrass and shame Mr. Pierson and his current company, which it does. The release may be gratifying to folks interested in hearing first hand what happened, but it does little towards assisting players and may not even prevent iovation from a future in legalized poker.

&gt;&gt; And who is “the mysterious third entity that made out with all of the internal administrative materials as a personal Damoclean sword”? Is this person also involved in leaks? But why would this person be engaged in conduct that will damage his/her employer? You say she works for iovation in come capacity

Wicked Chops wrote an indepth examination of the case that would be helpful to read. Hamilton had three key assistants in 2007. Bonnie Leinhos has helped Hamilton with logistics and financial areas, Travis Makar helped with computers and daily issues and Carolyn Heick was the person tasked with handling UltimateBet administrative tasks. Her initials are on most of Hamilton&#039;s cheating accounts initiating and/or approving changes, etc. Heick set up UB&#039;s customer service division, ran the anti-fraud unit, and worked directly for Greg Pierson, James Ryan and Russ Hamilton at various times. She told people at Cereus in 2008 that she had a &quot;trove&quot; of documents/evidence she removed from company servers and that if she were blamed for the scandal, she would bring the entire company down. UltimateBeat will detail these areas.

Thanks for your interest.]]></description>
