		<description><![CDATA[PokerStars has shown both financial and game integraty.  They have work with the IRS to pay all their outstanding balances to US players, and they are also working to settle some of the balanaces of less responsible poker sites.  I have played on PokerStars at least four years and have never felt I have gotten less then a fair game.
If you want to deny someone look at Revel, it seems to me they sold their creditors a bag of worms with regards to operating a financial viable casino.
I would think PokerStars with their world wide experience in providing online gaming
would not have to invent the wheel (poker site gaming protocal) and be able to hit the ground running, with the Division of Gaming Enforcements permission and start generating much needed revenue dollars for New Jersey quickly
I  ask the Division of Gaming Enforcement, please allow PokerStars to purchase Atlantic Club Casino and permit them (PokerStars) to operate and online gaming site in New Jersey.]]></description>
