		<description><![CDATA[I liked Gambling a lot better back when the Mafia controlled everything and we all knew it.  Now, they hide behind their legal commissions and still make decisions on who gets to have a casino and who doesn&#039;t.  These guys were the ones who were really involved when PokerStars was shut down to U.S. players and it really pisses me off!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Something here doesn&#039;t pass the smell test.  Was the Caesars offer a sucker deal for PokerStars, knowing PS might not even get a license in NV?   Why the Rio?  Was/is Caesars just trying to dump it for cash?

It also sounds like there a conflicting interests in the AGA.  If back round tests on all parties are applied, who is left that is clean?   Anybody?  Is that the norm in the industry?]]></description>
