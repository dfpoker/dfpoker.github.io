		<description><![CDATA[While some view this as a positive step forward, I am a little skeptical.  Most of the issues to be corrected could have been dealt with already.  It seems like a stalling tactic.  And unfortunately the fate of online poker is tied to internet casino gambling in New Jersey.  It would be better if it could stand alone.  Good luck, though.  I wonder if anyone has already moved to New Jersey in anticipation of playing poker online?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s (the conditional veto) already listed as being back to the State assembly.  Hopefully things will move quickly in both houses (not sure how much will be give and take, but most experts seem to think it will get done), then back to Christie.  Fingers crossed that its a matter of weeks only.  Will certainly be watching.]]></description>

The amendments are clearly stated in his paper, so if they implement these change will it fly back to his desk? Whens our next sweat and whens the first room to open?]]></description>
